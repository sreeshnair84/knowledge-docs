# Part 5 — Skills vs. MCP & the Full Responsibility Stack (+ Deliverable 3)

## 5.1 The layered stack for coding agents

```
Skill                (behavior: when/why/how to approach a class of task)
  │  references
  ▼
Tool                 (built-in capability: read/write file, run terminal, git op)
  │  OR reaches beyond built-ins via
  ▼
MCP Server            (external system access: GitHub, Jira, DB, browser, cloud)
  │  runs inside
  ▼
IDE / Extension        (UI surface, chat participant, editor commands)
  │  which may run inside
  ▼
Dev Container / Sandbox (reproducible, isolated execution environment)
  │  on top of
  ▼
Language Server         (symbol/type/diagnostic ground truth — usually consulted
                          by tools, not by skills directly)
```

## 5.2 What belongs in each layer

| Layer | Owns | Does NOT own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Skill** | Procedure, sequencing, project-specific judgment, output-format conventions | File I/O, process execution, protocol handshakes |
| **AGENTS.md/Rules** | Always-true facts and boundaries (stack, conventions, verification steps) | Deep multi-step procedures (that's a Skill's job — see file `01`) |
| **Tool** (built-in) | Filesystem, terminal, git, basic search (grep/ripgrep) — typically shipped natively by the harness | Business/procedural judgment about when to use them |
| **MCP Server** | Auth boundary + protocol framing for any *external* system: GitHub issues/PRs, Jira, Linear, databases, browsers, cloud providers, Kubernetes, Terraform | Editor UI, language-specific diagnostics |
| **IDE/Extension** | Chat UI, inline suggestions, commands, editor lifecycle hooks, workspace/task/debug APIs | Deep procedural knowledge (delegates to Skills), external system access (delegates to MCP) |
| **Language Server (LSP)** | Ground-truth symbol resolution, type info, diagnostics, go-to-definition | Anything LLM-mediated — LSP is deterministic, non-generative infrastructure that *tools* consult |
| **Dev Container/Sandbox** | Reproducible OS/dependency environment, isolation boundary | Application logic, procedural knowledge |

## 5.3 The specific chain named in the brief

```
Skill → Tool → MCP → IDE → CLI → Git → Filesystem → Terminal → Docker →
Cloud → Language Server
```

Mapped concretely:

- **Skill** references a **Tool** by name/intent in its instructions ("use the test-runner tool").
- The **Tool** is exposed by either the **IDE** (VS Code's built-in file/terminal/git tools) or the **CLI** (Claude Code's, Codex's own built-in tool set) — largely redundant implementations of the same primitives across surfaces.
- **Git** and **Filesystem** are near-universally *built-in* tools, not MCP-mediated, in every mainstream coding agent studied — this is a deliberate design choice for latency and reliability; MCP is reserved for genuinely external systems.
- **Terminal** access is likewise typically native, wrapped in a sandbox (file `10`) rather than routed through MCP.
- **Docker** and **Cloud** access is a mixed picture: some agents shell out to the `docker`/cloud CLI as a terminal command; others use a dedicated MCP server (Docker's own MCP catalog exposes 200+ verified MCP servers, explicitly positioned as the more secure and governed path versus raw shell access).
- **Language Server** sits underneath tools, not beside them — an agent's "find all references" tool is typically implemented *using* LSP under the hood, but the model never talks to the language server directly.

## 5.4 Avoiding duplication across this stack

The most common coding-assistant-specific duplication failure mode, not present in the same form in enterprise business agents: **the same primitive capability (file read, terminal exec, git diff) is reimplemented slightly differently by every IDE/CLI surface**, because each vendor ships its own built-in tool set rather than sharing one. This is a structural, largely unavoidable duplication (each harness needs its own sandboxed implementation), but it means:

- **Skills should never assume a specific tool name/signature** beyond the small set of near-universal primitives (read, write, search, run-command, git-diff) — a skill written against one vendor's exact tool name will silently fail to find that tool on another vendor's harness, defeating the entire cross-tool portability promise of SKILL.md.
- **MCP servers are the correct place to consolidate genuinely duplicated *external-system* integrations.** If three different teams each hand-roll a "call our internal deployment API" skill with embedded curl commands, that's a sign a shared internal MCP server is missing (directly analogous to the enterprise "avoid duplicate wrappers" guidance, companion package file `06`).
- **Don't build a skill to wrap a single MCP tool 1:1.** If a skill's entire content is "call the `create_pull_request` MCP tool with these arguments," that's a thin, low-value wrapper — the tool's own description (file `05`) should already carry that guidance.

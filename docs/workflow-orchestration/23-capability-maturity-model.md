# Orchestration Capability Maturity Model (CMM)

> **As of July 2026.** Maturity model for enterprises progressing from manual processes to autonomous orchestrated AI systems.

This guide defines a five-level Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for workflow and AI orchestration. It tells you where you are today, what the next level looks like, what investment is required to get there, and where the risks are at each stage.

---

## Model Overview

```
Level 5: Autonomous ──────── Self-optimizing, multi-agent, learns from outcomes
Level 4: AI-Enabled ─────── Agents making decisions, governed AI, monitored quality
Level 3: Governed ───────── Standards, versioning, governance, compliance evidence
Level 2: Orchestrated ────── Temporal or Camunda running defined workflows reliably
Level 1: Ad Hoc ─────────── Manual processes, point-to-point integrations, no orchestration
```

Most enterprises in 2026 are at **Level 2–3**. Early movers are at **Level 4**. Level 5 is the emerging frontier.

---

## Level 1: Ad Hoc

### What You Have

- Manual processes managed via email, spreadsheets, and tribal knowledge
- Point-to-point integrations written per-project (REST calls, cron jobs, scripts)
- No observability — something broke? Check Slack first
- Recovery strategy: "Someone fixes it"
- No standard for how processes are defined, versioned, or communicated

### Symptoms of Level 1

| Symptom | Example |
| --- | --- |
| No workflow definition | "We process refunds manually — John knows the steps" |
| No durability | Cron job fails at 2am, nobody knows until morning |
| No versioning | "What changed last week?" "Not sure" |
| No observability | "How long does onboarding take?" "It varies" |
| High toil | Engineers spend 30%+ of time on operational fire-fighting |

### Investment to Reach Level 2

- Effort: 3–6 months
- Team: 2–4 engineers + a process analyst
- Technology: Choose Temporal or Camunda (see [Decision Matrix](./decision-matrix))
- Risk: Change management — teams accustomed to manual control resist orchestration

---

## Level 2: Orchestrated

### What You Have

- Workflows defined in code (Temporal) or BPMN (Camunda) for 50%+ of critical processes
- Durable execution: workflows survive crashes, retry on failure
- Basic monitoring: success/failure rates, duration
- Deployment: workflows deployed via CI/CD
- Team capability: engineers can write and deploy workflows independently

### Example Architecture (Level 2)

```

│  Temporal Workflow       │
│  - Validate input        │
│  - Charge payment        │
│  - Send confirmation     │
│  - Retry on failure      │
└─────────────────────────┘

```

### Key Capabilities at Level 2

- [ ] Durable execution for critical workflows
- [ ] Automated retry with configurable policies
- [ ] Basic audit trail (which workflows ran, succeeded/failed)
- [ ] CI/CD for workflow deployments
- [ ] On-call playbook for workflow failures

### Investment to Reach Level 3

- Effort: 3–6 months
- Team: Add governance/platform role
- Technology: Version control for all workflow artifacts, governance tooling
- Risk: Governance introduces friction — teams may bypass it under pressure

---

## Level 3: Governed

### What You Have

- Versioning for all workflow artifacts (code, BPMN, DMN tables, configuration)
- Formal approval process for workflow changes (change management)
- Compliance evidence available on demand (audit trail, decision history)
- Standards documented and enforced (naming conventions, retry policies, error handling)
- Rollback procedures tested and documented

### Governance Maturity Indicators

```python
# You know you're at Level 3 when you can answer all of these:
LEVEL_3_AUDIT_QUESTIONS = [
    "Which version of the refund workflow was running at 2pm on March 15?",
    "Who approved the last change to the underwriting decision table?",
    "How many times has this workflow been retried in the last 30 days?",
    "What is the SLA breach rate for the payment workflow?",
    "Show me the rollback procedure for a broken workflow deployment.",
]
```

### Example Architecture (Level 3)

│  - SLA compliance reports                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Investment to Reach Level 4

- Effort: 6–12 months
- Team: AI engineers, ML/LLM expertise, prompt engineering
- Technology: LangGraph or equivalent, LLM API integration, vector store for memory
- Risk: AI quality — agents may perform worse than deterministic rules on well-understood tasks

---

## Level 4: AI-Enabled

### What You Have

- LLM agents making decisions for ambiguous, complex, or novel cases
- AI quality measurement (human override rate, decision accuracy, drift detection)
- Governed AI: prompt versioning, model version pinning, A/B testing
- Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions
- Multi-system orchestration: Temporal + LangGraph working together

### Decision Quality Metrics (Level 4)

```python
LEVEL_4_QUALITY_METRICS = {
    "human_override_rate": {
        "target": "<0.10",  # < 10% of agent decisions overridden by humans
        "alert_threshold": 0.15,
        "meaning": "If > 15%, agent quality has degraded",
    },
    "decision_consistency": {
        "target": ">0.92",  # same case → same decision ≥ 92% of time
        "measurement": "Send identical test cases weekly",
        "meaning": "Prompt drift or model change causes inconsistency",
    },
    "false_rejection_rate": {
        "target": "<0.05",  # < 5% of truly eligible applications rejected
        "measurement": "Sample rejected decisions, human-review a random subset",
        "meaning": "Core business quality metric",
    },
}
```

└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Investment to Reach Level 5

- Effort: 12–24 months
- Team: Specialized multi-agent systems engineers, AI safety expertise
- Technology: A2A protocols, autonomous agent frameworks, reinforcement learning
- Risk: Autonomy introduces new failure modes that are harder to detect and correct

---

## Level 5: Autonomous

### What You Have

- Agents that proactively identify work, not just respond to requests
- Multi-agent systems that coordinate autonomously to achieve business goals
- Self-optimization: system learns from outcomes and adjusts prompts/tools/routing
- Self-healing: agents detect degradation and adapt without human intervention
- Continuous improvement loop: A/B testing of agent strategies runs perpetually

### Characteristics of Level 5

```
Level 5 behaviors:
  ✓ "Agent monitors loan portfolio and proactively flags concentration risk"
  ✓ "Agent A detects it needs information only Agent B has → calls Agent B"
  ✓ "System detects its override rate rising → triggers prompt review automatically"
  ✓ "Agent adjusts its tool-calling strategy based on last week's failure patterns"
```

### Level 5 Risk Factors

Level 5 is powerful and dangerous:

- **Autonomy amplifies errors**: A self-optimizing agent that drifts in the wrong direction can make thousands of wrong decisions before detection
- **Explainability degrades**: Self-modified agents may be harder to audit
- **Governance must be continuous**: Manual governance review cycles are insufficient at Level 5 — automated governance required

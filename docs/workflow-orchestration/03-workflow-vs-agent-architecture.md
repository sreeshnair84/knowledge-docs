# Workflow vs Agent Architecture

## The Fundamental Distinction

A **workflow** is a predetermined sequence of steps with explicit decision points.  
An **agent** is a system that observes context, reasons about actions, and adapts in real-time.

| Aspect | Workflow | Agent |
|---|---|---|
| **Control flow** | Pre-defined in code/diagram | Emergent, learned |
| **State representation** | Explicit (step N of M) | Implicit (memory + context) |
| **Decision logic** | If-then rules or code | Reasoning over observations |
| **Tool invocation** | Explicit, predetermined | Dynamic, based on reasoning |
| **Failure mode** | Crash or halt | Retry with different approach |
| **Observability** | Clear: "We're at step 7" | Opaque: "Why did it choose this?" |
| **Determinism** | Guaranteed | Probabilistic |
| **Human oversight** | Approval gates | Reasoning review |

### Visual Comparison

#### Workflow (Camunda/Temporal)
```
┌──────────┐
│  Start   │
└────┬─────┘
     │
     ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│ Validate Input   │
└────┬─────────────┘
     │
     ▼
┌──────────────────┐      NO
│ Check Condition? ├──────────┐
└────┬─────────────┘          │
     │ YES                     │
     ▼                         ▼
┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│  Process A   │         │  Process B   │
└────┬─────────┘         └────┬─────────┘
     │                        │
     └────────┬───────────────┘
              ▼
         ┌─────────┐
         │   End   │
         └─────────┘
```

**Execution**: Start → Validate → Check → Process A or B → End  
**State tracking**: "We are at: Check Condition"  
**Restart after failure**: From the last checkpoint

---

#### Agent (LangGraph)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent with tools + memory              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  loop:                                  │
│    1. Observe context + memory          │
│    2. Reason: "What tools do I need?"   │
│    3. Invoke tools (dynamic)            │
│    4. Update memory with results        │
│    5. Check: Done?                      │
│       - If YES: return result           │
│       - If NO: continue loop            │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Execution**: Reason → Tool → Observe → Reason → Tool → ... → Result  
**State tracking**: "Memory contains: ..."  
**Retry after failure**: Ask LLM to try a different tool

## The Four Workflow Paradigms

### 1. **Deterministic Workflow** (Temporal, Camunda)
**Model**: `State A → Transition (deterministic) → State B`

**Example: Payment Processing**
```
Order received →
  Validate payment details (fail → reject order) →
  Charge card (fail → retry 3x, then manual review) →
  Update inventory (fail → refund) →
  Send confirmation →
Complete
```

**Characteristics**:
- Path is knowable before execution
- Same inputs = same path (replay works)
- Failures are expected, handled explicitly
- Outcome is predictable

**Best for**: Financial transactions, order fulfillment, compliance-heavy processes

---

### 2. **Probabilistic Workflow** (LangGraph with LLMs)
**Model**: `Context + Reasoning → Probabilistic Action → Observe → Loop`

**Example: Customer Support Ticket**
```
Ticket received →
  Agent reads ticket, prior interactions, policies
  → Reasons: "Is this a refund request or technical support?"
  → If refund: "What's the issue? Within policy? History?"
    → May invoke tools: refund policy lookup, customer history, precedent search
    → Decides: "Approve refund" or "Escalate"
  → If technical: "Can I resolve this?" 
    → Invokes knowledge base, logs, past solutions
    → Attempts fix → Test → Success? → Complete
```

**Characteristics**:
- Path is not predetermined
- Same inputs might take different paths (non-deterministic)
- Reasoning is the control flow
- Outcome depends on context + model

**Best for**: Support, analysis, decision-making, discovery

---

### 3. **Adaptive Workflow** (Agentic AI with learning)
**Model**: `Observe → Reason → Act → Learn → Adjust future behavior`

**Example: Inventory Optimization**
```
Daily: Agent observes
  - Current inventory levels
  - Historical demand patterns
  - Lead times from suppliers
  - Seasonal trends
  - Forecast models

Reasons: "Which SKUs should we order?"
  - Uses ML models (trained on past data)
  - Considers constraints (budget, warehouse space)
  - Evaluates risk (stockout vs overstock)

Acts: 
  - Places orders
  - Sets reorder points
  - Adjusts prices if needed

Learns:
  - Actual demand vs. forecast
  - Supplier performance
  - Outcome of decisions
  - Updates models for next cycle
```

**Characteristics**:
- Behavior changes based on outcomes
- Same situation today ≠ same action tomorrow
- Models improve over time
- Requires feedback loops

**Best for**: Optimization, dynamic pricing, resource allocation, personalization

---

### 4. **Autonomous Workflow** (Future state)
**Model**: `Self-modifying orchestration + multi-agent coordination`

**Example: Fraud Detection (Speculative)**
```
System detects unusual transaction
  → Agent A (data analyst): 
      Investigates historical patterns, flags anomaly
  → Agent B (compliance): 
      Checks regulations, determines risk level
  → Agent C (decision maker):
      Coordinates A + B → Decides action (approve, review, decline)
      → May invoke Agent D (customer contact): Verify with customer
  → Agent E (learning):
      Logs decision + outcome → Trains next iteration of models
  → System self-modifies:
      "We were wrong on 3% of cases; adjust threshold"
```

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple agents coordinate autonomously
- System improves without human code changes
- Objectives may shift dynamically
- True autonomy (but with guardrails)

**Best for**: Complex systems, emergent behavior, next-decade architectures

## Design Principle: The Determinism Spectrum

```
DETERMINISTIC ─────────────────────────────────► PROBABILISTIC
     ↑                                                  ↑
Workflow                  Hybrid                    Agent
(Fixed path)          (Structured routing         (Emergent
                      to agents)                   reasoning)

  Temporal
  Camunda
  Step Functions
                    Temporal + LangGraph
                    Camunda + AI Rules
                                              LangGraph
                                              CrewAI
                                              Claude Code
```

### Guidance: Where Should Your Process Live?

**Ask these questions**:

1. **Is the process path knowable upfront?**
   - YES → Workflow (Temporal/Camunda)
   - PARTIALLY → Hybrid (Workflow routes to agent)
   - NO → Agent (LangGraph)

2. **Must outcomes be identical for audit?**
   - YES → Workflow (determinism required)
   - NO → Agent (probabilistic OK)

3. **Do humans need to see the path before execution?**
   - YES → Camunda (visual modeling)
   - NO → Temporal or LangGraph

4. **Will the process logic change frequently?**
   - YES → Agent (prompts easier to change than code)
   - NO → Workflow (infrastructure investment makes sense)

5. **Does success require reasoning over data?**
   - YES → Agent (reasoning is the value)
   - NO → Workflow (coordination is the value)

---

## The Hybrid Model (Most Common in 2026)

Most enterprises don't choose: **Workflow OR Agent**. They choose **Workflow + Agent**.

### Pattern: Workflow Delegates to Agent

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Temporal Workflow: "Process customer request"   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│ Step 1: Validate input (deterministic)         │
│   → Activity: schema validation                │
│                                                 │
│ Step 2: Get fulfillment decision (adaptive)    │
│   → Activity: Invoke LangGraph agent           │
│      └─ Agent reasons about context            │
│      └─ Agent invokes tools                    │
│      └─ Returns decision + reasoning           │
│                                                 │
│ Step 3: Execute fulfillment (deterministic)    │
│   → Activity: call fulfillment service         │
│                                                 │
│ Step 4: Notify customer (deterministic)        │
│   → Activity: send email                       │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Ownership**:
- **Temporal**: Coordinates the overall flow, ensures reliability, tracks state
- **LangGraph Agent**: Makes the complex decision (reasoning, tool invocation)
- **Activities**: Deterministic actions (validation, email, API calls)

**Benefits**:
- Temporal handles **reliability** (what if agent times out? → retry logic)
- Agent handles **reasoning** (complex decisions)
- Clear separation of concerns

**Example: Loan Approval**

```typescript
// Temporal Workflow
workflow LoanApproval {
  const application = await activities.getApplication(appId)
  await activities.validateInputs(application)  // deterministic
  
  // Delegate decision to agent
  const agentDecision = await activities.getApprovalDecision(application)
  // Agent invoked LangGraph:
  //   - Analyzed credit score
  //   - Checked income verification
  //   - Looked up precedents
  //   - Returned: { decision: 'approve', reasoning: '...', score: 750 }
  
  if (agentDecision.decision === 'approve') {
    await activities.fundLoan(application)
  } else {
    await activities.notifyRejection(application, agentDecision.reasoning)
  }
}
```

## State Management: Workflow State vs. Agent Memory

### Workflow State (Temporal)
**What**: "What task are we on? What variables have we set?"  
**Where**: Workflow history (event sourced)  
**Durability**: Permanent; survives crashes  
**Semantics**: Deterministic; replayable

```
Event Log:
  1. WorkflowStarted { appId: 123 }
  2. ActivityCompleted { taskName: 'validate', result: valid }
  3. ActivityCompleted { taskName: 'decision', result: approved }
  4. ActivityStarted { taskName: 'fund' }
  5. [If crash here, replay from event 1-3, re-execute 4]
```

### Agent Memory (LangGraph)
**What**: "What does the agent know? What's the context?"  
**Where**: Vector store, message history, knowledge graph  
**Durability**: Persistent but mutable; learned over time  
**Semantics**: Probabilistic; not replayed

```
Agent Memory:
  - Conversation history: [user msg, assistant msg, ...]
  - Facts: { customer_id: 456, credit_score: 750, income: $100k }
  - Learned patterns: { similar_cases: [case_A, case_B] }
  - Next action: "Need to verify employment"
```

### How They Complement

**Workflow State**: "We are at step 2: Getting approval decision"  
**Agent Memory**: "The customer's income is unverified; I should check employment first"

Workflow asks: **Where are we?**  
Agent asks: **What should we do next?**

---

## Observability: What to Log Where

### Workflow Observability (Temporal)
```json
{
  "workflowId": "loan-123",
  "status": "running",
  "currentStep": "approval_decision",
  "timeline": [
    { "timestamp": "10:00", "event": "started" },
    { "timestamp": "10:01", "event": "validation_complete", "result": "valid" },
    { "timestamp": "10:02", "event": "agent_invoked" },
    { "timestamp": "10:05", "event": "agent_returned", "result": "approved" }
  ]
}
```

**Questions it answers**:
- Where is the workflow?
- When did each step complete?
- How many retries happened?
- When did it finish?

### Agent Observability (LangGraph + Tracing)
```json
{
  "agentId": "loan-approver",
  "reasoning_trace": [
    { "step": 1, "thought": "Analyzing credit score...", "tool": "credit_lookup" },
    { "step": 2, "thought": "Checking income...", "tool": "income_verify" },
    { "step": 3, "thought": "Found 3 similar cases...", "tool": "case_search" },
    { "step": 4, "thought": "Within policy; recommend approval", "action": "return_decision" }
  ],
  "decision": "approve",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

**Questions it answers**:
- What was the agent thinking?
- Which tools did it invoke?
- Why did it make this decision?
- What was the confidence level?

### Combined Observability
A mature system logs **both**:
- Workflow traces (for SLA/operational monitoring)
- Agent reasoning traces (for explainability/audit)
- Business outcome traces (did the decision work?)

---

## Error Handling: Workflow vs. Agent

### Workflow Error Handling
```typescript
workflow PaymentSettlement {
  try {
    await activities.withdrawMoney(accountA, amount)
    await activities.depositMoney(accountB, amount)
  } catch (error) {
    // Temporal automatically retries based on retry policy
    // If all retries fail, workflow ends with error
    // Compensation: manual (you must code refunds)
  }
}
```

**Semantics**: Fail and retry. If exhausted, escalate.

### Agent Error Handling
```python
agent_state = {
  "objective": "approve loan",
  "tools": [credit_check, income_verify, case_search],
  "memory": [...]
}

while not done:
  reasoning = llm.think(agent_state)
  tool = reasoning.select_tool()
  
  try:
    result = tool.invoke(reasoning.args)
  except ToolError:
    # Agent learns: "This tool doesn't work for this input"
    reasoning.add_context("Tool failed; try different approach")
    continue
  
  agent_state.memory.append(result)
```

**Semantics**: Fail and adapt. Try a different tool or approach.

---

## Security & Compliance

### Workflow-based Compliance
- **Audit trail**: Event log proves workflow followed intended path
- **Version control**: Workflow code is versioned, approved, deployed
- **Determinism**: Replay can verify correctness

```
"Prove the order was processed correctly":
  → Replay workflow from events
  → Confirm sequence: validate → check balance → charge → ship
  → Audit satisfied
```

### Agent-based Compliance (Harder)
- **Audit trail**: Reasoning trace shows what agent thought
- **Version control**: Prompt version, model version matter (not code version)
- **Non-determinism**: Same input today ≠ same action tomorrow

```
"Prove the decision was fair":
  → Review reasoning trace: "Agent considered X, Y, Z"
  → Review model version: "Used Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
  → Review training data: "Model trained on 2024 data"
  → But: Can't replay with certainty
```

**Enterprise implication**: For compliance-critical decisions, **combine**:
- Agent reasoning (for analysis)
- Workflow coordination (for audit trail)
- Human review (for approval)

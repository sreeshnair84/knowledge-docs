```

No framework is universally best. The right choice depends on control flow needs, type-safety requirements, language preference, and cloud platform.

---

## LangGraph

**Best for**: Stateful multi-step agents where you need explicit control over the reasoning loop.

LangGraph 1.2.8 models agent execution as a **directed graph** — nodes are functions, edges are transitions. You can see, control, and debug exactly which nodes ran and why, unlike frameworks that hide the loop inside a black box.

```python
# pip install langgraph==1.2.8
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-6")
tools = [lookup_account, check_policy, draft_response]
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

def call_model(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

def should_continue(state: AgentState) -> str:
    last = state["messages"][-1]
    return "tools" if last.tool_calls else END

graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("agent", call_model)
graph.add_node("tools", tool_node)
graph.set_entry_point("agent")
graph.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue)
graph.add_edge("tools", "agent")

# Compile with checkpointing (enables pause/resume)
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver
memory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(":memory:")
app = graph.compile(checkpointer=memory)

result = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Resolve billing dispute for account A-123"}]},
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "dispute-A-123"}},
)
```

**State management**: TypedDict schema, persisted via checkpointer (SQLite, Postgres, Redis). Supports pause/resume — a human approval gate can suspend the graph and resume it when approved.

**Tool handling**: LangChain tools or `ToolNode` prebuilt. Tool calling is explicit in the graph — you decide when the agent can call tools vs. when it must reason.

**Multi-agent**: Supervisor patterns with subgraphs. Each agent is a compiled subgraph; a supervisor routes between them via conditional edges.

**Temporal integration**: LangGraph runs naturally inside a Temporal activity. The compiled `app.invoke(...)` is a single function call.

**When to choose LangGraph**:

- You need explicit control over the reasoning loop
- You want pause/resume for human-in-the-loop gates
- You are building multi-agent workflows with defined handoffs
- You need to debug exactly which nodes ran and in what order

---

## CrewAI

**Best for**: Role-based teams of agents working on decomposed tasks in sequence or parallel.

CrewAI models the problem as a **crew** (team of agents) executing **tasks**. Each agent has a role, goal, and backstory. Tasks flow through the crew according to a process.

```python
# pip install crewai==0.80.0
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

claude = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-6")

researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Analyst",
    goal="Find accurate information about the topic and synthesize key findings",
    backstory="Expert in enterprise architecture with 10 years of distributed systems experience",
    tools=[search_tool, read_tool],
    llm=claude,
    verbose=True,
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Technical Writer",
    goal="Convert research into clear, structured architectural guidance",
    backstory="Specializes in enterprise documentation and architecture decision records",
    llm=claude,
    verbose=True,
)

research_task = Task(
    description="Research the current state of agent orchestration frameworks in 2026. Focus on production adoption, limitations, and enterprise fit.",
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output="A structured summary of framework capabilities with concrete trade-offs",
)

write_task = Task(
    description="Write an architectural comparison guide based on the research. Target audience: enterprise architects choosing a framework.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[research_task],  # writer receives researcher's output as context
    expected_output="A 2000-word comparison guide with a recommendation matrix",
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result.raw)
```

**State management**: Task outputs are passed as context between tasks. Long-term memory available via `memory=True` on `Crew` — backed by ChromaDB.

**Multi-agent**: Built-in via crew composition. `Process.hierarchical` adds a manager agent that delegates and routes tasks.

**When to choose CrewAI**:

- Your problem naturally decomposes into roles (researcher, analyst, writer, reviewer)
- You want a readable, declarative team definition
- You are building content pipelines, research workflows, or report generation
- You don't need fine-grained control over the reasoning loop

---

## PydanticAI

**Best for**: Type-safe agents where the correctness of structured output matters more than flexibility.

PydanticAI wraps LLM calls with Pydantic models for input validation and output parsing. The agent is less a free-form reasoning engine and more a **typed extraction pipeline** with LLM steps.

```python
# pip install pydantic-ai==0.0.54
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

class LoanDecision(BaseModel):
    approved: bool
    credit_score_used: int = Field(ge=300, le=850)
    debt_to_income_ratio: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    reason: str
    suggested_rate: Optional[float] = Field(default=None, ge=0.01, le=0.30)
    conditions: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)

loan_agent = Agent(
    "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    result_type=LoanDecision,
    system_prompt=(
        "You are a loan underwriting agent for a regulated financial institution. "
        "Analyze the application data provided via tools and return a structured underwriting decision. "
        "You must use the credit score and income tools before making a decision."
    ),
)

@loan_agent.tool
async def get_credit_score(ctx, applicant_id: str) -> int:
    """Fetches credit score from bureau. Returns integer 300-850."""
    return await credit_bureau_client.fetch_score(applicant_id)

@loan_agent.tool
async def get_income_verification(ctx, applicant_id: str) -> dict:
    """Returns verified annual income and employment status."""
    return await income_verifier.fetch(applicant_id)

@loan_agent.tool
async def get_existing_debts(ctx, applicant_id: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Returns list of current debt obligations with monthly payments."""
    return await debt_registry.fetch(applicant_id)

async def underwrite(applicant_id: str) -> LoanDecision:
    result = await loan_agent.run(f"Underwrite loan application for applicant {applicant_id}")
    return result.data  # LoanDecision — fully typed and validated

decision = asyncio.run(underwrite("APP-456"))
assert isinstance(decision.approved, bool)  # always — Pydantic guarantees it
```

**State management**: Stateless by design — each run is independent. Pass context explicitly as tool return values.

**Testing**: Straightforward to unit test — mock tools, assert on typed output. No hidden state to account for.

**When to choose PydanticAI**:

- Structured output correctness is critical (finance, compliance, healthcare, legal)
- You need to validate LLM output against a business schema before acting
- You want simple, testable agents without orchestration overhead
- Regulatory requirements demand auditable, predictable outputs

## Google ADK

**Best for**: Google Cloud-native workloads, and systems that use Vertex AI, Google Search, or BigQuery.

Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) 1.0 is designed around Google's agent ecosystem — tight integration with Vertex AI models, Google Search grounding, and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.

```python
# pip install google-adk==1.0.0
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search, code_execution
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.adk.runners import Runner

root_agent = Agent(
    name="research_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",  # or claude via Vertex AI
    description="Researches topics using Google Search and summarizes findings",
    instruction="""
    You are a research agent. When given a topic:
    1. Search for current information using the search tool
    2. Synthesize findings into a structured summary
    3. Include sources for all factual claims
    """,
    tools=[google_search, code_execution],
)

# Multi-agent: ADK uses sub-agents natively
coordinator = Agent(
    name="coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Coordinates research and analysis tasks",
    instruction="Delegate research to sub-agents and synthesize results",
    sub_agents=[root_agent, analysis_agent],
)

session_service = InMemorySessionService()
runner = Runner(
    agent=coordinator,
    app_name="research_app",
    session_service=session_service,
)

import asyncio
from google.genai import types

async def run_research(query: str) -> str:
    session = await session_service.create_session(app_name="research_app", user_id="user-1")
    content = types.Content(role="user", parts=[types.Part(text=query)])
    events = runner.run_async(user_id="user-1", session_id=session.id, new_message=content)

    async for event in events:
        if event.is_final_response():
            return event.content.parts[0].text

result = asyncio.run(run_research("Latest enterprise orchestration trends 2026"))
```

**State management**: Session-based. `InMemorySessionService` for development; `VertexAiSessionService` for production (backed by Spanner).

**A2A protocol**: ADK implements Google's A2A protocol natively — agents discover each other via `.well-known/agent.json` endpoints and communicate via structured messages.

**When to choose Google ADK**:

- You are on Google Cloud (Vertex AI, BigQuery, GKE)
- You need Google Search grounding out of the box
- You want A2A protocol compliance for multi-agent interoperability
- Your team is building with Gemini models

---

## Mastra

**Best for**: TypeScript teams building full-stack agentic applications with built-in memory and workflow support.

Mastra is a TypeScript-first framework designed to ship complete agent applications — not just the LLM reasoning layer. It includes built-in memory, workflows (similar to LangGraph), integrations, and an eval framework.

```typescript
// npm install @mastra/core@0.10
import { Mastra, Agent, createTool } from "@mastra/core";
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

const getLoanStatus = createTool({
  id: "get-loan-status",
  description: "Retrieves the current status of a loan application",
  inputSchema: z.object({ applicationId: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    status: z.enum(["pending", "approved", "rejected", "under_review"]),
    amount: z.number(),
    applicantName: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    return await loanDatabase.getApplication(context.applicationId);
  },
});

const loanAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Loan Agent",
  instructions: `You are a loan servicing agent. Help customers understand
    their loan application status and answer questions about the process.`,
  model: {
    provider: "ANTHROPIC",
    toolChoice: "auto",
    name: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  },
  tools: { getLoanStatus },
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { loanAgent },
});

// Use in a Next.js API route, Express handler, etc.
const agent = mastra.getAgent("loanAgent");
const response = await agent.generate(
  "What is the status of my application APP-123?",
  { threadId: "customer-session-456" }  // built-in memory across turns
);
console.log(response.text);
```

**State management**: Built-in memory via `threadId` — conversations persist across requests without external setup. Backed by Postgres or LibSQL.

**Workflows**: Mastra has a first-class workflow primitive (similar to LangGraph graphs) for multi-step agent pipelines with branching, parallel steps, and retry.

**Multi-agent**: Supported via agent handoffs in workflows. One agent can invoke another as a step.

**When to choose Mastra**:

- Your team works in TypeScript and prefers a Node.js ecosystem
- You are building a full application (API + agent + UI) not just the agent layer
- You want memory management out of the box without configuring vector stores
- You need to ship quickly with sensible defaults

## Microsoft Agent Framework SDK

**Best for**: Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 ecosystems — enterprises already invested in Azure AI Foundry, Entra ID, and Microsoft 365 infrastructure.

Microsoft Agent Framework SDK (part of Azure AI Foundry, GA 2025) is Microsoft's **production-grade, managed agent development SDK** — positioned as the enterprise path distinct from the research-oriented AutoGen and the lower-level Semantic Kernel integration toolkit. It provides a standardised way to build, host, and orchestrate agents on Azure with native integration to Azure AI services, Microsoft Entra ID, and Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility.

**Positioning vs. other Microsoft offerings:**

- **Semantic Kernel**: Lower-level AI integration SDK for building plugins/skills; useful as a building block but not a complete agent framework
- **AutoGen (AG2)**: Multi-agent research framework for AI-to-AI conversation patterns; not recommended for production enterprise agents
- **Microsoft Agent Framework SDK**: The recommended production path — managed hosting, enterprise auth, compliance controls, M365 integration

```python
# pip install azure-ai-projects azure-ai-inference azure-identity
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.ai.projects.models import (
    AgentDefinition,
    BingGroundingTool,
    FunctionTool,
    ThreadMessage,
)
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Authenticate using Entra ID (managed identity in production)
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint="https://<foundry-endpoint>.azure.com",
    credential=credential,
)

# Define tools — functions + Microsoft-native connectors
def get_customer_account(customer_id: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves customer account details from CRM."""
    return crm_client.get_account(customer_id)

def update_account_status(customer_id: str, status: str) -> bool:
    """Updates customer account status. Requires Entra ID role: CRM.Write."""
    return crm_client.update_status(customer_id, status)

# Create agent with Azure AI Foundry — managed, persisted, version-controlled
agent = client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o",  # or any Azure AI model: claude via Azure, Llama, Mistral
    name="customer-service-agent",
    instructions="""
    You are a customer service agent for enterprise accounts.
    Retrieve account details before taking any action.
    Always confirm before updating account status.
    Log every action taken for compliance audit trail.
    """,
    tools=[
        FunctionTool(functions=[get_customer_account, update_account_status]),
        BingGroundingTool(),  # Microsoft-native grounding
    ],
)

# Create a thread (conversation session)
thread = client.agents.create_thread()

# Add a user message
client.agents.create_message(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="Review account C-8832 and flag it if their last payment was over 90 days ago.",
)

# Run the agent
run = client.agents.create_and_process_run(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    agent_id=agent.id,
)

# Retrieve the response
messages = client.agents.list_messages(thread_id=thread.id)
for msg in messages.data:
    if msg.role == "assistant":
        print(msg.content[0].text.value)
```

**Enterprise capabilities built in:**

| Capability | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Identity & access** | Microsoft Entra ID integration; agent identity is an Entra service principal; function tools can enforce Entra roles |
| **Audit trail** | All agent runs logged to Azure Monitor; queryable via Log Analytics |
| **Compliance** | Azure compliance controls (GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP) inherited; data residency enforced by Azure region |
| **Multi-model** | Azure AI Foundry supports OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Meta Llama, Mistral, Cohere — agent can use any approved model |
| **Knowledge grounding** | Bing Grounding Tool; Azure AI Search connector; SharePoint connector |
| **M365 integration** | Agents deployable as Copilot extensions; native Teams integration |
| **Vector store** | Azure AI Search as managed vector store; no external vector DB required |
| **Streaming** | Server-sent events streaming natively supported |
| **Monitoring** | Azure AI Foundry tracing; OpenTelemetry-compatible spans |

**Multi-agent coordination:**

```python
# Microsoft Agent Framework supports multi-agent patterns via Connected Agents
# Each agent is a separate Foundry agent; the orchestrator delegates via tool calls

# Orchestrator agent definition
orchestrator = client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    name="orchestrator",
    instructions="Coordinate specialist agents to complete complex tasks.",
    tools=[
        # Sub-agents exposed as tools to the orchestrator
        ConnectedAgentTool(agent_id=research_agent.id, name="research"),
        ConnectedAgentTool(agent_id=analysis_agent.id, name="analysis"),
        ConnectedAgentTool(agent_id=writer_agent.id, name="write"),
    ],
)
```

**State management**: Thread-based session state persisted in Azure AI Foundry (Cosmos DB backend). Threads survive agent restarts and can be resumed. Long-term memory via Azure AI Search vector index.

**Temporal integration**: Agent runs are synchronous within a Temporal activity; use `create_and_process_run()` with polling for long-running tasks. Temporal owns the workflow durability; Foundry agent owns the reasoning.

```python
from temporalio import activity

@activity.defn
async def run_foundry_agent(customer_id: str, task: str) -> str:
    thread = client.agents.create_thread()
    client.agents.create_message(thread_id=thread.id, role="user", content=task)
    run = client.agents.create_and_process_run(
        thread_id=thread.id, agent_id=agent.id
    )
    msgs = client.agents.list_messages(thread_id=thread.id)
    return msgs.data[0].content[0].text.value
```

**When to choose Microsoft Agent Framework SDK:**

- Your enterprise is Azure-first with Entra ID and Microsoft 365
- You need compliance-ready agents (GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP) without bespoke compliance engineering
- You want to deploy agents as Microsoft 365 Copilot extensions
- Your team needs managed infrastructure (no vector DB ops, no model hosting ops)
- Enterprise procurement prefers Microsoft's unified SLA and support model
- You need built-in Entra ID role-based access control for agent tool permissions

## Integrating with Temporal

All frameworks can run as a Temporal activity — Temporal owns durability, the framework owns reasoning:

```python
from temporalio import activity
from datetime import timedelta

@activity.defn
async def run_langgraph_agent(input_data: dict) -> dict:
    from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver

    memory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(":memory:")
    app = build_graph().compile(checkpointer=memory)

    result = await app.ainvoke(
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": input_data["goal"]}]},
        config={"configurable": {"thread_id": input_data["run_id"]}},
    )
    return {"result": result["messages"][-1].content}

# In Temporal workflow:
# agent_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
#     run_langgraph_agent,
#     {"goal": "...", "run_id": workflow.info().workflow_id},
#     start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
# )
```

Temporal handles: guaranteed execution, retries, audit trail, long-running coordination.  
The agent framework handles: reasoning, tool selection, and adaptive behavior within a bounded step.

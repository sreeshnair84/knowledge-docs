# Enterprise Agent Interoperability & Orchestration Governance

> **Current as of July 2026.** Covers the MCP + A2A two-layer protocol stack, Agent Cards and registries, multi-agent governance, agentic payments (AP2/x402), and the single-orchestrator vs peer-mesh architectural decision.

---

## 1. Why Interoperability Now

In 2025, most enterprise agent deployments were siloed — one vendor's agents talking to that vendor's tools. By mid-2026, **nearly 60% of CIOs are planning enterprise-wide agentic deployments** spanning multiple vendors ([Gartner, 2026](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-20-gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2026)).

The result is a new class of architectural problem: how do agents from different vendors, running on different runtimes, call each other's tools and delegate tasks — reliably, securely, and with governance controls that span the boundary?

The industry converged on two complementary standards that now form the **enterprise default protocol stack**:

```
  Agent ────────────── A2A ─────────────── Agent
   │                                         │
  MCP                                       MCP
   │                                         │
  Tool / API / DB                      Tool / API / DB
```

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol): the vertical layer — connects *any agent* to *any tool, API, or data source*
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent): the horizontal layer — connects *agents to each other* for task delegation and collaboration

---

## 2. MCP: The Agent-to-Tool Standard

### 2.1 Governance & Status

MCP was created by Anthropic (November 2024) and donated to the **Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** on December 9, 2025, co-founded with Block and OpenAI; backed by Google, Microsoft, and AWS. [(Anthropic announcement)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation)

**July 2026 status:**
- **10,000+ public MCP servers** in official registry; community aggregators list 16–20k
- **~110M monthly SDK downloads** ([AAIF, 2026](https://aaif.io/blog/mcp-is-growing-up/))
- **2026-07-28 stateless spec release candidate** — the protocol layer is stateless; all state lives in the application; final spec publishes July 28, 2026 ([MCP blog](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/))
- Supported natively in: Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Microsoft Copilot, VS Code, Cursor

### 2.2 Core Primitives

| Primitive | What it is | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **Tools** | Executable functions the agent can call | API calls, database queries, computations |
| **Resources** | Read-only data the agent can retrieve | Documents, config, live data feeds |
| **Prompts** | Parameterized prompt templates | Consistent agent behaviors |
| **Sampling** | Agent-initiated LLM completion requests | Nested reasoning, evaluation |

**2026 spec additions:**
- **Extensions** — a formal framework for protocol extensions (replaces ad-hoc custom features)
- **Tasks** (promoted from experimental) — long-running async operations with status tracking
- **MCP Apps** — bundled configurations for sharing agent setups
- **Authorization hardening** — OAuth 2.1 with RFC 9207 issuer validation mandatory; PKCE required

### 2.3 Enterprise MCP Governance

An enterprise MCP deployment is not a list of public servers. It requires:

```
Enterprise MCP Registry
    ├── Internal servers (approved, maintained by platform team)
    │    ├── crm-mcp-server (read: contacts, accounts)
    │    ├── erp-mcp-server (read: orders, inventory)
    │    └── hr-mcp-server (read: approved employee data only)
    │
    ├── Approved external servers (vetted, versioned)
    │    └── [version-pinned, supply-chain reviewed]
    │
    └── Blocked / Quarantined
         └── [servers removed for security incidents]
```

Governance controls:
- **Allow-list only** — agents cannot call MCP servers not in the enterprise registry
- **Version pinning** — pin to exact MCP server versions; automated alerts on upstream changes
- **Tool-call audit** — every MCP tool call logged (server, tool, parameters, result, agent SVID)
- **Supply chain scanning** — vet public MCP servers before internal approval; monitor for malicious updates

---

## 3. A2A: The Agent-to-Agent Standard

### 3.1 Governance & Status

Google released A2A in April 2025 and donated it to the **Linux Foundation** as the *Agent2Agent Project* in June 2025 ([Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-cloud-donates-a2a-to-linux-foundation/)). Members include AWS, Cisco, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow.

**July 2026 status:**
- **A2A v1.0 stable** — shipped April 2026
- **150+ supporting organizations** ([Linux Foundation press release](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/a2a-protocol-surpasses-150-organizations-lands-in-major-cloud-platforms-and-sees-enterprise-production-use-in-first-year))
- **GA integrations:** Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
- EY, JPMorgan, and Salesforce reported production-scale deployments

### 3.2 Core Primitives

| Primitive | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agent Card** | A JSON-LD document an agent serves at `/.well-known/agent.json` declaring: name, version, capabilities, supported modalities, authentication requirements, endpoint URL |
| **Task** | A unit of work sent from one agent to another; has status (pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled) |
| **Artifact** | The output of a completed Task — structured data, files, or messages |
| **Message** | Turn-by-turn exchange within a Task for clarification or streaming updates |

### 3.3 Agent Cards: Discovery and Governance

Agent Cards are the **trust anchor for multi-agent systems**. An enterprise architect should treat the Agent Card as a declaration of intent that governance tools can validate:

```json
{
  "name": "credit-risk-agent",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "description": "Evaluates credit applications against policy",
  "url": "https://agents.internal/credit-risk",
  "capabilities": {
    "tasks": ["evaluate_application"],
    "modalities": ["text", "data"]
  },
  "authentication": {
    "schemes": ["oauth2"],
    "oauth2": {
      "authorization_url": "https://auth.internal/authorize",
      "required_scopes": ["credit:read", "policy:read"]
    }
  },
  "governance": {
    "owner": "credit-platform-team@bank.com",
    "data_classification": "CONFIDENTIAL",
    "human_oversight_tier": "APPROVAL_GATED",
    "review_date": "2027-01-01"
  }
}
```

The `governance` block is non-standard — add it as an enterprise extension. Tools like your policy engine can validate Agent Cards at task-dispatch time against your data-classification and oversight-tier rules.

## 4. Protocol Landscape: MCP, A2A, ACP, x402, AP2

| Protocol | Layer | Governed by | Status | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP** | Agent ↔ Tool | Linux Foundation AAIF | Stateless spec RC (July 2026) | Tools, resources, prompts |
| **A2A** | Agent ↔ Agent | Linux Foundation | v1.0 stable (April 2026) | Task delegation, collaboration |
| **ACP** (Agent Communication Protocol) | Agent ↔ Agent (alternate) | BeeAI / Linux Foundation | Draft | Alternative to A2A; convergence discussions ongoing |
| **x402** | Agent → Payment | Coinbase/open standard | Production | HTTP-native micropayments; per-request agent billing |
| **AP2** | Agent → Payments (enterprise) | Google-led, 60+ partners | GA | Cryptographic payment mandates for high-value transactions |

**Convergence direction:** MCP and A2A are the dominant protocols; ACP and MCP are in convergence discussions. The [Zylos protocol map (2026)](https://zylos.ai/research/2026-03-26-agent-interoperability-protocols-mcp-a2a-acp-convergence/) provides the most current analysis.

## 5. Agent Registries as Governance Control Points

An agent registry is not just a catalog — it is an **enforcement point**:

```
Agent Dispatch Request
    │
    ▼
Registry Lookup
    ├── Is this agent registered? → REJECT if not
    ├── Is this agent version allowed? → REJECT if blocked version
    ├── Does caller have permission to invoke this agent?
    ├── Does the task fit within this agent's declared capabilities?
    └── Is the agent within its operational window (not decommissioned)?
    │
    ▼ (all checks pass)
Agent Invocation
```

**Governance lifecycle via the registry:**

| Stage | Registry Action |
|---|---|
| **Provisioning** | Agent registered with SVID, capability declaration, owner, oversight tier |
| **Active** | Monitored; capability drift alerts; version updates tracked |
| **Suspended** | Agent blocked from invocation (security incident or compliance hold) |
| **Decommissioned** | Registry tombstone; credentials revoked; historical record preserved |

---

## 6. Multi-Agent Governance Patterns

### 6.1 Cross-Vendor Agent Trust

Agents from different vendors must establish trust without sharing secrets. The A2A Agent Card + OAuth 2.1 pattern handles this:

1. Agent A fetches Agent B's Agent Card from `/.well-known/agent.json`
2. Validates the card signature against Agent B's published key
3. Negotiates auth using the scheme declared in the card (OAuth 2.1)
4. Issues a scoped delegation token for the specific task
5. Both parties record the interaction in their audit logs

### 6.2 Delegation Limits

Set maximum delegation depth at the policy layer. Unbounded chains are a primary runaway-agent risk:

```yaml
# orchestration-policy.yaml
max_delegation_depth: 3        # orchestrator → sub → leaf max
max_concurrent_sub_agents: 10  # per task
max_task_duration_minutes: 60  # before timeout + escalation
max_tool_calls_per_task: 200   # circuit breaker
```

### 6.3 Request-Level Policy Enforcement

Every agent-to-agent task invocation should be evaluated by a policy engine:

```
A2A Task Request
    │
    ▼
Policy Engine (OPA / Cedar)
    Input: {caller_id, callee_id, task_type, data_classification,
            user_context, delegation_depth, estimated_cost}
    Rules: decision_rights.rego / decision_rights.cedar
    │
    ├── ALLOW → proceed
    ├── NOTIFY → proceed + notify owner
    └── REJECT → return error to caller
```

---

## 7. Agentic Payments

Enterprise agents that transact financially need payment protocols as rigorous as their security controls.

### 7.1 AP2 (Agents-to-Payments Protocol)

**Google's AP2** ([announcement](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol)) provides **cryptographic payment mandates** — signed proofs that a specific human authorized a specific transaction:

- 60+ partners including Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe, major banks
- Agent receives a signed mandate from the human: `\{amount:$500, merchant:Acme, expiry:+1hour, purpose:order-123}`
- Mandate travels with the agent through delegation; cannot be forged or replayed
- Payment processor validates the mandate independently of the agent

**Use for:** high-value B2B transactions, procurement flows, regulated payments.

### 7.2 x402 (HTTP-Native Micropayments)

**x402** ([Coinbase/open](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/x402-and-agentic-commerce-redefining-autonomous-payments-in-financial-services/)) uses HTTP 402 (Payment Required) status codes to enable **per-request billing**:

- Agent calls an API → server responds 402 with payment terms
- Agent evaluates whether it's authorized to pay (within budget)
- Pays via stablecoin or traditional payment rail; server delivers response
- Zero pre-registration required between parties

**Use for:** data APIs, per-use services, agent-to-agent micropayments. AWS Bedrock AgentCore Payments implements x402 for agent marketplace transactions.

### 7.3 Spend Controls

Regardless of payment protocol, enforce spend controls at the orchestrator:

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Per-task budget cap | Orchestrator rejects tool calls that would exceed task budget |
| Daily/monthly agent limits | Registry-enforced spending envelope per agent identity |
| Anomaly detection | Alert when agent spend rate exceeds 2× 7-day average |
| Approval gate | Purchases > threshold require human approval (see §4 of security guide) |

---

## 8. Observability: OTel GenAI Semantic Conventions

The **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions** ([OTel blog 2026](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2026/genai-observability/)) define standard span attributes for agent operations, enabling vendor-neutral tracing across A2A hops:

| Span name | Attributes | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `invoke_agent` | `gen_ai.agent.name`, `gen_ai.agent.id`, `gen_ai.system` | Trace delegation across agents |
| `execute_tool` | `gen_ai.tool.name`, `gen_ai.tool.type`, `gen_ai.agent.id` | Trace every tool call |
| `gen_ai.client.token.usage` | `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `model`, `agent_id` | Token cost attribution |
| `gen_ai.request` | `model`, `temperature`, `max_tokens` | Model invocation details |

**Key principle:** spans propagate across A2A boundaries using standard W3C trace context headers. A trace initiated by a human user should be traceable end-to-end through every agent delegation and tool call.

Native support: Datadog, Grafana, AWS X-Ray (with OTel collector).

### 8.1 Trajectory Evaluation vs Final-Answer Evaluation

Traditional LLM evals test: *did the model give the right answer?*

Agent evals must also test: *did the agent take the right path?*

| Eval type | What it checks | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Final-answer | Did the task complete correctly? | Always; baseline |
| Trajectory | Did the agent use the right tools, in the right order, with appropriate scope? | Production readiness; regulatory compliance |
| Cost trajectory | Did the agent accomplish the task within budget? | Cost governance |

A documented **37% lab-to-production performance gap** ([Morph, 2026](https://www.morphllm.com/ai-agent-evaluation)) motivates trajectory evals in staging — agents that pass final-answer evals often fail in production due to different tool response patterns.

## 9. Failure Modes & Mitigations

| Failure | Description | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Cascading delegation loop** | Agent A calls Agent B which calls Agent A; infinite loop burns tokens | Max delegation depth (§6.2) + call graph cycle detection |
| **Runaway spend** | Agent spawns sub-agents each spawning more; cost compounds exponentially | Concurrent sub-agent cap + total task spend cap + circuit breaker |
| **Split-brain orchestration** | Two orchestrators both delegate to the same sub-agent with conflicting tasks | Sub-agent registry: one owner per task; task claim/lock before execution |
| **Stale Agent Card** | Agent invoked with an outdated capability declaration; expects different tool contract | Agent Card TTL; registry validates card freshness on each invocation |
| **Context smuggling** | Attacker embeds A2A task content that hijacks the receiving agent's goal (ASI01) | Trust tier enforcement: A2A task content treated as EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED |

---

## 10. Decision Guide: Single Orchestrator vs Peer Mesh

| Criterion | Single Orchestrator | Registry-Mediated Peer Mesh |
|---|---|---|
| **Simplicity** | ✅ Easier to reason about | Requires registry infrastructure |
| **Scale** | Bottleneck at orchestrator | ✅ Horizontal scaling |
| **Fault tolerance** | Single point of failure | ✅ Agents can reroute around failures |
| **Governance** | ✅ Centralized policy enforcement | Policy enforced at registry (harder) |
| **Audit** | ✅ Central audit point | Distributed; requires OTel aggregation |
| **Cross-vendor** | Hard when orchestrator is vendor-specific | ✅ A2A provides vendor-neutral delegation |
| **Runaway risk** | Easier to bound | Harder; requires stricter depth limits |

**Choose single orchestrator when:** regulated environment, all agents in one vendor's ecosystem, audit simplicity required, team is new to multi-agent patterns.

**Choose peer mesh when:** agents span multiple vendors, orchestrator throughput is a bottleneck, resilience to single-agent failure is required, and you have mature OTel observability.

```
Decision:
Is this a regulated environment with strict audit requirements?
  YES → Single orchestrator (centralized policy + audit)
  NO  → Do agents span multiple vendors?
          YES → Peer mesh with A2A + central registry
          NO  → Single orchestrator (simpler to start)
```

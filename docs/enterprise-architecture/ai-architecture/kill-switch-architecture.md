# Kill Switch Architecture for Multi-Agent AI Systems

**Audience:** Platform engineers, AI architects, SREs, CISO/security teams, and AI governance teams responsible for emergency response.

**Purpose:** Defines the complete kill switch architecture for enterprise multi-agent AI systems — covering global, scoped, and progressive shutdown mechanisms; safe mode; circuit isolation; feature flags; emergency policy override; and the governance model for who can activate each level.

**Scope:** Emergency shutdown and containment mechanisms. For the underlying circuit breaker reliability pattern, see [Agentic AI Reliability, Observability & Governance §4.3](agentic-ai-reliability-observability-governance.md). For the observability that triggers kill switch activation, see [Agent Reliability Engineering](agent-reliability-engineering.md). For governance of kill switch authority, see [Governance Propagation Chain](governance-propagation-chain.md).

## 1. Why Kill Switches Are a First-Class Architectural Concern

Kill switches are not an afterthought — they are a fundamental trust mechanism. Regulators, enterprise risk teams, and users must have confidence that **any agent can be stopped immediately**, regardless of what it is doing, without requiring a code deployment or infrastructure change.

The EU AI Act Article 9 (risk management) requires high-risk AI systems to include "appropriate human oversight measures" including the ability to halt the system. DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) requires financial firms to be able to terminate AI-driven processes that pose operational risk.

**Key design principle:** Kill switches must work when the system is under load, when the normal communication paths are degraded, and when the agent is in the middle of a long-running task.

---

## 2. Kill Switch Taxonomy

### 2.1 Scope Levels

| Level | Scope | Propagation Time Target | Who Can Activate |
|-------|-------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Global kill** | All AI agents in the enterprise | < 30 seconds | CISO, CTO, On-call incident commander |
| **Platform kill** | All agents on a specific platform/region | < 30 seconds | Platform Team Lead, On-call SRE |
| **Tenant kill** | All agents for a specific tenant/customer | < 60 seconds | Tenant Admin, Platform Team |
| **Agent kill** | A specific named agent | < 30 seconds | Platform Team, On-call SRE |
| **Tool kill** | A specific tool/MCP server across all agents | < 30 seconds | Platform Team, Tool Owner |
| **Workflow kill** | A specific workflow run | < 30 seconds | Platform Team, Workflow Owner |
| **Model kill** | All calls to a specific model provider or model ID | < 60 seconds | Platform Team Lead |
| **Memory disable** | Disable long-term memory read/write for specified agents | < 60 seconds | Platform Team, AI Governance |
| **Retrieval disable** | Disable RAG retrieval for specified agents | < 60 seconds | Platform Team, AI Governance |
| **Remote agent isolation** | Block all A2A calls to/from a specific remote agent | < 30 seconds | Security Team, Platform Team |

### 2.2 Mechanism Types

| Mechanism | How It Works | Propagation Speed | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Feature flag** (real-time) | Centralized flag service; agents poll every 5s or use long-poll | 5–30 seconds | Planned disablement; graduated rollout |
| **Policy override** | Emergency deny rule pushed to all OPA/Cedar instances | < 30 seconds | Security incident; unauthorized behavior |
| **Gateway block** | Gateway rejects all requests for the target scope | < 5 seconds | Immediate containment; easiest to activate |
| **Circuit breaker open** | Circuit breaker forced-open programmatically | < 5 seconds | Provider failure; quality failure |
| **Capability suspension** | Agent registry marks agent as suspended; all calls refused | < 30 seconds | Agent misbehavior; compliance hold |
| **Credential revocation** | Agent's workload certificate / token revoked | < 60 seconds (OCSP/CRL propagation) | Compromised agent identity |
| **Process termination** | Kill the agent process directly | Immediate | Last resort; may leave state inconsistent |

### 3.2 Feature Flag Kill Switch

Feature flags provide the most controllable kill switch — graduated, reversible, audited:

```
Kill Switch Flag Store (LaunchDarkly / AWS AppConfig / Azure App Config / Unleash)
    │
    ├─► Global: ai.agents.enabled = false
    ├─► Platform: ai.platform.us-east-1.enabled = false
    ├─► Agent: ai.agent.billing-agent.enabled = false
    ├─► Tool: ai.tool.funds-transfer.enabled = false
    ├─► Model: ai.model.claude-opus.enabled = false
    └─► Tenant: ai.tenant.acme-corp.enabled = false
```

**Agent implementation (required at every agent):**

```python
async def execute_agent_task(task: AgentTask) -> AgentResult:
    # Kill switch check BEFORE any work begins
    if not await feature_flags.is_enabled(f"ai.agent.{agent_id}.enabled"):
        raise AgentSuspendedError(
            code="AGENT_SUSPENDED",
            message="Agent temporarily disabled by platform governance"
        )
    
    # Kill switch check DURING long-running tasks (at every step boundary)
    for step in plan.steps:
        if not await feature_flags.is_enabled(f"ai.agent.{agent_id}.enabled"):
            raise AgentSuspendedMidTaskError(
                completed_steps=completed_steps,
                checkpoint=current_checkpoint
            )
        await execute_step(step)
```

**Flag polling requirement:** Agents must poll kill switch flags at intervals ≤ 5 seconds (real-time). Long-running agents must check the kill switch flag at every step boundary, not just at invocation start.

### 3.3 Gateway-Level Kill Switch

The gateway is the fastest and most reliable kill switch for inbound traffic:

```
Kill Switch Activation
        │ (API call to Gateway Admin API)
        ▼
Gateway Kill Switch Rule:
  match: agent_id == "billing-agent"
  action: REJECT with HTTP 503
  reason: "Agent suspended by governance - ref: INC-8821"
  log: all rejected requests
  duration: until explicitly lifted

Effect:
  All new requests to billing-agent → rejected immediately
  In-flight requests → completed (drain period) or killed (hard stop)
  User experience → 503 with governance message
```

**Drain vs. hard stop choice:**
- **Drain** (allow in-flight requests to complete): use for non-security incidents where graceful completion is preferred
- **Hard stop** (kill in-flight immediately): use for security incidents (prompt injection, data exfiltration in progress)

### 3.4 Policy Override Kill Switch

For scenarios where the agent bypassed the gateway (internal calls, scheduled tasks):

```
Emergency Policy Rule (OPA / Cedar)
────────────────────────────────────
# OPA: emergency deny for specific agent
package emergency.overrides

deny[msg] {
  input.agent_id == "billing-agent"
  msg := "Agent billing-agent suspended - INC-8821"
}

# This rule takes precedence over all permit rules
# Must be propagated to all OPA instances in < 30 seconds
```

**Propagation mechanism:** OPA bundle update pushed to all OPA sidecar instances via bundle server. Each sidecar polls every 5–10 seconds (configurable). Target: < 30 seconds global propagation.

### 3.5 Capability Suspension in Agent Registry

Suspending an agent in the central registry prevents new dispatches:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "billing-agent",
  "status": "suspended",
  "suspension_reason": "INC-8821: anomalous billing lookups detected",
  "suspended_at": "2026-07-14T15:30:00Z",
  "suspended_by": "platform-oncall@acme.com",
  "review_scheduled": "2026-07-14T17:00:00Z"
}
```

All components that dispatch work to agents (Planner, Supervisor, A2A gateway) must check agent registry status before dispatching. A suspended agent receives no new tasks.

---

## 4. Safe Mode

Safe mode is a degraded operating state that maintains basic functionality while disabling AI-powered features. It is activated when AI systems must be suspended but the underlying service must remain available.

```
NORMAL MODE                    SAFE MODE
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Agent answers questions         Fallback to knowledge base search
Agent routes to specialist      Fixed routing rules (no ML)
Agent drafts emails             Email drafting disabled
Agent processes claims          Claims queued for human review
Agent monitors for anomalies    Rule-based alerting only
Agent interprets contracts      Contract review routed to legal team
```

### Safe Mode Activation Playbook

```
Trigger: Global kill switch activated for AI agents

1. Gateway switches to safe-mode ruleset:
   - All AI-agent endpoints → fallback handler
   - Fallback handler serves static/rule-based responses

2. UI displays safe-mode banner:
   - "AI features temporarily unavailable. Using assisted mode."

3. Work queue accumulates:
   - Unprocessed AI tasks enter a durable queue
   - Queue monitored for SLA breaches
   - Human review team notified of queue depth

4. Communications:
   - Users notified via status page
   - Account teams notified if enterprise customers affected

5. AI reactivation:
   - Requires: root cause identified + resolved
   - Requires: sign-off from: Platform Lead + AI Governance + (CISO if security incident)
   - Reactivation is gradual (canary first, then full rollout)
```

---

## 5. Progressive Shutdown

Progressive shutdown reduces blast radius by stopping in a controlled sequence:

```
Step 1: Feature flag → disable new task acceptance
        (agent finishes current tasks; accepts no new ones)
        Wait: 30 seconds
        
Step 2: Gateway kill → reject new requests
        (belt-and-suspenders; catches requests that bypassed flag check)
        Wait: 30 seconds for drain

Step 3: Cancel in-flight tasks
        (send cancellation signal to all active task IDs)
        Wait: 60 seconds for graceful cancellation

Step 4: Force-terminate remaining tasks
        (checkpoint state; kill processes)
        Wait: 10 seconds

Step 5: Suspend agent registry entry
        (prevent any future dispatch)
        Immediate

Step 6: Revoke credentials (if security incident)
        (revoke SPIFFE SVID / OAuth tokens)
        OCSP propagation: < 60 seconds
```

For **security incidents** (compromised agent, active data exfiltration), skip Steps 1–4 and go directly to Steps 5–6 + gateway hard block.

---

## 6. Remote Agent Isolation (A2A)

When a remote agent (connected via A2A) is suspected of malicious behavior or has been compromised:

```
LOCAL ACTION                           EFFECT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Block outbound A2A to remote agent  No new tasks sent to remote agent
   (gateway rule: drop A2A calls to
    remote-agent-id)

2. Invalidate cached remote agent card  Local agents no longer discover remote agent
   (agent registry: mark as BLOCKED)

3. Revoke trust for remote agent's     All in-flight A2A responses rejected
   certificate/JWT issuer              (SPIFFE trust bundle updated)

4. Notify remote org                   Remote org can investigate their side
   (A2A protocol: send agent-status
    notification)

5. Audit: log all recent interactions  Compliance + forensics
   with the remote agent
```

---

## 7. Circuit Isolation

Circuit isolation prevents a failing component from cascading failures to other components:

```
Normal state:
  Agent A ──calls──► Tool X   (circuit: CLOSED)
  Agent B ──calls──► Tool X   (circuit: CLOSED)
  Agent C ──calls──► Tool X   (circuit: CLOSED)

Tool X starts failing (> 50% error rate):

Circuit isolation:
  Agent A ──calls──► [Circuit OPEN] ──► fallback response
  Agent B ──calls──► [Circuit OPEN] ──► fallback response
  Agent C ──calls──► [Circuit OPEN] ──► fallback response

Tool X isolated:
  - No calls pass to Tool X
  - Tool X can recover without load
  - After 60s, half-open probe: single call to test recovery
```

### Isolation Scope Matrix

| Failing Component | What Gets Isolated | Fallback |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Model provider (Claude) | All calls to that provider | Fallback to alternate provider |
| Vector store | All RAG retrieval | Direct context (no retrieval) |
| MCP server | That server's tools | Disable tools; agent works without them |
| Policy engine | Policy enforcement | Default-deny until engine recovers |
| Memory service | Long-term memory access | Session memory only |
| Remote agent | That A2A connection | Local agent handles task (degraded quality) |

---

## 8. Emergency Policy Override

During a security incident, the normal policy evaluation may need to be bypassed for an emergency override:

### 8.1 Emergency Deny Override

Supersedes all existing permit policies for the duration of the incident:

```python
# Emergency override structure
{
    "type": "emergency_deny",
    "scope": {
        "agent_ids": ["billing-agent", "funds-agent"],
        "action_classes": ["financial:write", "funds:transfer"]
    },
    "reason": "INC-8821: Suspected unauthorized access via prompt injection",
    "activated_by": "security-oncall@acme.com",
    "activated_at": "2026-07-14T15:30:00Z",
    "valid_until": "2026-07-14T17:30:00Z",  # Auto-expires; requires renewal
    "requires_review_by": "CISO"
}
```

**Auto-expiry:** Emergency overrides must auto-expire. Indefinite emergency overrides become permanent policy by default, which is a governance failure. Default TTL: 2 hours; renewal requires explicit re-authorization.

### 8.2 Human Approval Override

For actions that were previously automated, require human approval for the duration of the incident:

```
Under emergency conditions:
  All agent actions class "HIGH" → route to HITL queue
  All agent actions class "CRITICAL" → require CISO sign-off
  Automated financial actions → suspended; queue for treasury team review
```

---

## 9. Governance Model

### 9.1 Authority Matrix

| Kill Switch Level | Minimum Authority | CISO Must Approve? | Time Limit |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Global kill | CISO or CTO | Yes (or is activating) | 2 hours; review required |
| Platform kill | Platform Team Lead | No (notify within 15 min) | 4 hours |
| Tenant kill | Tenant Admin or Platform Team | No (notify within 30 min) | 8 hours |
| Agent kill | On-call SRE | No (notify within 30 min) | 24 hours |
| Tool kill | Tool Owner or On-call SRE | No | 24 hours |
| Model kill | Platform Team Lead | No (notify within 1 hour) | 8 hours |
| Memory disable | Platform Team or AI Governance | No | 24 hours |
| Remote agent isolation | Security Team or On-call SRE | If cross-org security incident: yes | 24 hours |

### 9.2 Audit Requirements

Every kill switch activation must produce a mandatory audit record:

```json
{
  "event_type": "kill_switch_activated",
  "event_id": "ks-2026-0714-001",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-14T15:30:00.123Z",
  "scope": "agent",
  "target": "billing-agent",
  "level": "agent_kill",
  "activated_by": {
    "identity": "platform-oncall@acme.com",
    "authentication_method": "OIDC + MFA",
    "ip_address": "10.0.1.45"
  },
  "reason": "Anomalous billing lookup rate: 10000 lookups/min vs normal 50/min",
  "incident_id": "INC-8821",
  "propagation_confirmed_at": "2026-07-14T15:30:28.000Z",
  "propagation_time_seconds": 28,
  "sla_met": true,
  "notifications_sent": ["platform-team@acme.com", "ai-governance@acme.com"],
  "auto_expires_at": "2026-07-14T17:30:00Z"
}
```

### 9.3 Reactivation Protocol

Reactivation requires explicit process, not just removing the kill switch:

```
1. Root cause documented (incident ticket)
2. Mitigation implemented (code fix, policy update, or containment measure)
3. Testing completed (eval suite passing; chaos test of the specific failure scenario)
4. Sign-off obtained:
   - For security incident: CISO + Platform Lead
   - For quality incident: AI Governance + Platform Lead
   - For operational incident: Platform Lead + On-call SRE
5. Canary reactivation: 5% of traffic → monitor for 30 min
6. Full reactivation if canary passes
7. Post-mortem completed within 24 hours of reactivation
```

---

## 10. Kill Switch Testing

Kill switches that are never tested will fail when needed. Test on a quarterly schedule:

| Test | What It Validates | How Often |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **Feature flag propagation** | Flag change propagates to all agents in < 30s | Monthly |
| **Gateway block** | New requests blocked within 5s; in-flight drained within 60s | Monthly |
| **Policy override** | Emergency deny propagates to all OPA instances in < 30s | Quarterly |
| **Agent registry suspension** | Suspended agent receives no new dispatches | Monthly |
| **Safe mode switchover** | Safe mode activates within 60s of activation | Quarterly |
| **Progressive shutdown** | Full progressive shutdown completes in < 5 minutes | Quarterly |
| **Remote agent isolation** | A2A calls to isolated remote agent fail in < 30s | Quarterly |
| **Reactivation process** | Reactivation flow can be completed in < 2 hours from approval | Quarterly |

Test results are logged and reviewed by AI Governance. Tests are not optional — untested kill switches are not kill switches.

# Drift Detection for Multi-Agent AI Systems

**Audience:** Platform engineers, AI architects, SREs, and MLOps engineers operating multi-agent systems in production.

**Purpose:** Defines how to detect, classify, measure, and respond to behavioral drift across all dimensions of a multi-agent AI system — from prompt drift through model drift to MCP contract drift and A2A capability drift.

**Scope:** Drift detection mechanics and response. For how drift is observed (spans, metrics), see [End-to-End Traceability Guide](end-to-end-traceability-guide.md) and [Agentic AI Reliability, Observability & Governance §6–8](agentic-ai-reliability-observability-governance.md). For chaos experiments that induce drift, see [Agent Reliability Engineering §5](agent-reliability-engineering.md).

## 1. The Drift Problem in Agentic Systems

In traditional software, drift = configuration has diverged from desired state (GitOps detects this). In AI systems, drift is multidimensional and stochastic:

- **Prompts** can drift as users find workarounds or as the system is modified
- **Models** drift when providers update weights between versions
- **Plans** drift when the planner makes systematically different choices over time
- **Tool selection** drifts when embedding models or routing logic changes
- **Data** drifts when the retrieval corpus changes semantically
- **Agents** drift when the MCP contract or A2A capability changes

A system can be green on all infrastructure metrics while silently producing different (and wrong) outputs. **Drift is the most common source of production quality degradation that traditional monitoring misses.**

## 2. Drift Taxonomy

### 2.1 Complete Drift Classification

| Drift Type | What Changes | Detection Method | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Prompt drift** | System prompt or user prompt templates diverge from baseline | Hash comparison; semantic similarity | High |
| **Planning drift** | Planner consistently chooses different decomposition strategies | Plan structure comparison; step-count distribution | High |
| **Reasoning drift** | Agent reasoning quality or style changes | LLM-judge scoring over time; inter-rater agreement | Medium |

## 3. Drift Detection Methods

### 3.1 Statistical Drift Detection

Apply statistical tests to agent output distributions over time:

**Population Stability Index (PSI):** Measures how much a distribution has shifted.

```
PSI = Σ (actual% - expected%) × ln(actual% / expected%)

PSI < 0.1  → Stable (no significant drift)
PSI 0.1–0.2 → Monitor (mild drift — investigate)
PSI > 0.2  → Alert (significant drift — action required)
```

Apply PSI to:
- Tool call frequency distribution (by tool, by day)
- Output length distribution
- Classification confidence score distribution
- Response latency distribution
- Routing decision distribution

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test:** Tests whether two samples are drawn from the same distribution. Use for continuous metrics: quality scores, similarity scores, cost-per-task.

**Jensen-Shannon Divergence:** Measures distribution divergence symmetrically. Use for comparing embedding space distributions before and after model updates.

### 3.2 Behavioral Fingerprinting

Create a behavioral fingerprint — a vector of stable behavioral metrics — and compare it to the baseline:

```python
class AgentBehavioralFingerprint:
    """
    A snapshot of stable behavioral metrics for an agent.
    Compare fingerprints to detect behavioral drift.
    """
    tool_selection_distribution: dict[str, float]  # {tool_name: call_frequency}
    avg_plan_depth: float                           # average steps per plan
    avg_replanning_rate: float                      # re-plans per task
    escalation_rate: float                          # HITL escalations per 100 tasks
    avg_output_token_count: float                   # tokens per response
    routing_accuracy: float                         # % correctly classified queries
    judge_pass_rate: float                          # % responses passing judge
    avg_retrieval_score: float                      # mean top-k similarity
    policy_deny_rate: float                         # % requests denied by policy
    error_distribution: dict[str, float]            # {error_class: frequency}
```

Compute the cosine distance between current fingerprint and baseline fingerprint. Distance > 0.15 → drift alert.

### 3.3 Semantic Drift Detection

For prompt and output quality drift, use semantic similarity:

```
Baseline: sample 100 representative outputs from week W0
Current:  sample 100 outputs from week Wn for same input distribution

Semantic drift score = 1 - cosine_similarity(
    embed(baseline_outputs),
    embed(current_outputs)
)

Score > 0.05 → semantic drift alert
```

**Embedding model caveat:** The embedding model used to measure semantic drift must be **stable** (pinned version). If the embedding model changes, recalibrate the baseline before comparing.

### 3.4 Contract Tests (MCP and A2A Drift)

For tool and agent contract drift, automated contract tests run continuously:

```python
# MCP contract test (runs on every deployment and every 24h in production)
def test_mcp_schema_stability(tool_name: str, expected_schema: dict):
    """Compares live MCP tool schema against expected (pinned) schema."""
    actual_schema = mcp_client.describe_tool(tool_name)

    # Schema hash comparison
    assert hash(actual_schema) == hash(expected_schema), \
        f"MCP tool '{tool_name}' schema changed: {diff(expected_schema, actual_schema)}"

    # Behavioral contract test
    test_input = CONTRACT_TEST_INPUTS[tool_name]
    actual_output = mcp_client.call_tool(tool_name, test_input)

    assert validate_output(actual_output, expected_schema.output_type), \
        f"MCP tool '{tool_name}' output format changed"

    assert actual_output.keys() == CONTRACT_OUTPUTS[tool_name].keys(), \
        f"MCP tool '{tool_name}' output fields changed"
```

## 4. Per-Drift-Type Detection and Response

### 4.1 Prompt Drift

**What drifts:** System prompt is modified (by accident, version mismatch, or deliberate change without proper change management).

**Detection:**
- Hash the deployed system prompt on every agent startup; compare to the prompt registry
- Alert if deployed hash ≠ registry hash for the current version
- Track prompt semantic similarity over time (even minor wording changes can cause significant behavior changes)

**Response:**
- Hash mismatch → block deployment; require change management review
- Semantic drift in output → trigger prompt audit; roll back to last known-good version
- Alert to: Platform team + AI governance team

**GitOps integration:** System prompts stored in Git. The CI pipeline validates the hash match between Git and the deployment. Unauthorized prompt changes are impossible without a merge.

---

### 4.2 Model Drift

**What drifts:** The model provider updates the underlying model weights, RLHF tuning, or safety filters without changing the model version string.

**Detection:**
- **Fingerprint probes:** Send a fixed set of "canary prompts" to the model daily; compare responses to baseline using semantic similarity + judge score
- **Eval suite regression:** Run the full eval suite after any deployment or detected version change
- **Output distribution monitoring:** Monitor token count distribution, vocabulary richness, refusal rate; sudden shifts indicate model update

**Warning signs:**
- Refusal rate increases → safety tuning updated
- Output length distribution shifts → temperature or sampling changed
- Specific tool call patterns disappear → the model learned new strategies

**Response:**
- Pin the model version explicitly (e.g., `claude-opus-4-8-20261001` not `claude-opus-4-8`)
- On drift detection: notify team; run eval suite immediately
- If quality regression confirmed: escalate to vendor; roll back to pinned previous version if possible

---

### 4.3 Embedding Drift

**What drifts:** The embedding model used for RAG retrieval changes, causing semantic similarity scores to shift and previously relevant chunks to become irrelevant (or vice versa).

**Detection — ANN Neighbor Stability:**
```
Embed a fixed probe set of 100 queries using the current embedding model.
For each probe, retrieve the top-5 nearest neighbors.
Compare the neighbor set to the baseline top-5 for the same queries.

Neighbor overlap score = |current_top5 ∩ baseline_top5| / 5

Score < 0.8 → embedding drift alert (significant neighborhood change)
```

**Detection — Retrieval Accuracy:**
- Maintain a golden set of (query, expected_source) pairs
- Run golden set retrieval daily; measure recall@5 against expected sources
- Alert if recall@5 drops > 5 percentage points from baseline

**Response:**
- Pin the embedding model version (same version for indexing and querying)
- On embedding model update: **re-index the entire corpus** before switching queries to the new model
- Never mix index vectors (old embedding model) with query vectors (new embedding model) — results will be nonsensical

---

### 4.4 Memory Drift

**What drifts:** Long-term agent memory accumulates incorrect beliefs, outdated facts, or conflicting entries over time.

**Detection:**
- **Contradiction detection:** Scan memory entries for semantic contradictions (two entries that make opposite claims)
- **Staleness scoring:** Assign a time-decay weight to memory entries; entries not accessed or confirmed in 30 days are flagged for review
- **Fact verification:** Sample 10 memory entries per week; verify against authoritative source
- **Belief consistency check:** For a set of test queries, compare agent responses with and without memory; large divergence in factual claims indicates memory contamination

**Response:**
- Memory expiry: set TTL on memory entries based on content type (facts: 30 days; user preferences: 90 days; enterprise policies: until explicitly updated)
- Conflict resolution: when a contradiction is detected, quarantine both entries; surface for human review
- Memory audit: monthly sample audit by domain expert

---

### 4.5 Planning Drift

**What drifts:** The planner consistently decomposes the same task class differently than it did at baseline — e.g., adding unnecessary steps, choosing different worker roles, or changing the plan depth.

**Detection:**
- **Plan structure comparison:** For a set of standard test tasks, compare current plan structure to baseline (step count, step types, worker assignments)
- **Distribution monitoring:** Monitor average plan depth per task class over time; alert on > 20% change

**Response:**
- If plan drift is intentional (model updated): validate that the new plans produce better outcomes (eval suite)
- If plan drift is unintentional: investigate prompt change, model change, or context pollution
- Alert to: Platform team; notify if it results in quality regression

---

### 4.6 MCP Contract Drift

**What drifts:** An MCP server updates its tool schema, output format, or behavior without notifying dependent agents.

**Detection — Schema Hash Monitoring:**
```
Every 24 hours (or on MCP server deployment):
1. Query: GET /mcp/tools/list
2. Hash the complete tool list schema
3. Compare to pinned schema hash in the contract registry
4. If hash changed: alert + block agent from upgrading to new MCP server version without review
```

**Detection — Behavioral Contract Tests:**
- Send a standard test call to each registered MCP tool
- Validate: output schema matches expected type, required fields present, output within expected value ranges
- Alert on: type change, field addition/removal, behavioral change

**Response:**
- Schema change: version the MCP contract; require migration review before agents adopt new version
- Silent behavioral change (schema same, behavior different): severity = CRITICAL (vendor communication + rollback)
- Alert to: Platform team + consuming agent teams + MCP server team

---

### 4.7 A2A Capability Drift

**What drifts:** A remote agent's published capabilities (in its agent card) diverge from its actual behavior.

**Detection:**
- **Agent card validation:** Compare the remote agent's published `agent_card.json` to its actual behavior using probes
- **Skill regression tests:** Send standard skill test requests to registered remote agents daily; validate responses match expected skill outputs
- **Response signature monitoring:** Monitor structural characteristics of A2A responses over time; significant changes indicate behavior change

**Response:**
- Capability drift confirmed: alert remote agent owner; isolate agent from production workflows until resolved
- Agent card updated without notification: treat as a breaking change; require re-review and agent version bump
- Alert to: Platform team + agent registry team + remote org contact

## 5. Drift Response Playbook

### 5.1 Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Actions |
|---------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Drift causing policy violations, safety failures, or data integrity issues | Immediate (< 15 min) | Alert on-call; suspend affected agents; escalate to CISO/CTO if security-related |
| **High** | Quality regression > 10%, routing accuracy < 90%, contract schema change | < 2 hours | Alert platform team; run eval suite; consider rollback |
| **Medium** | Quality regression 5–10%, behavioral fingerprint distance 0.1–0.2 | < 24 hours | Investigate; run targeted eval; no immediate rollback needed |
| **Low** | Minor behavioral fingerprint shift, non-material quality change | Next sprint | Investigate cause; update baseline if change is intentional |

### 5.2 The Drift Investigation Checklist

When drift is detected:

1. **Identify drift type** from the taxonomy (§2)
2. **Determine onset time** from telemetry (when did metrics first diverge?)
3. **Identify the change that caused it:**
   - Model version change? (check model fingerprint probes)
   - Prompt change? (check prompt registry hash)
   - Embedding model update? (check embedding version)
   - MCP server update? (check contract hash)
   - Data corpus change? (check vector store index metadata)
   - Agent code deployment? (check deployment timeline)
4. **Assess impact:** which tasks, users, tenants affected?
5. **Decide: tolerate / fix / rollback**
6. **Implement mitigation** (patch, rollback, baseline update)
7. **Post-mortem** if severity was High or Critical

### 5.3 Rollback Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Action |
|---------|------------------|
| Model drift: quality improved | Update baseline; no rollback |
| Model drift: quality degraded | Pin previous version; contact vendor; do not upgrade until resolved |
| Embedding drift: re-indexed | No rollback; validate retrieval accuracy |
| Embedding drift: not re-indexed | Rollback embedding model immediately; schedule re-index |
| Prompt change: intentional, quality improved | Update baseline |
| Prompt change: unintentional | Roll back to last approved version; treat as unauthorized change |
| MCP schema change: additive only | Test; if backward-compatible, no rollback |
| MCP schema change: breaking | Rollback agent to version compatible with old schema; coordinate migration |
| A2A capability drift | Isolate remote agent; do not rollback local system; coordinate with remote org |

### 6.2 Baseline Management

| Baseline Type | Update Trigger | Who Approves |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Behavioral fingerprint | After every intentional model/prompt update | AI Platform Team + Quality Owner |
| Embedding neighbor stability | After every embedding model update + re-index | Platform Team |
| Eval suite scores | After every model upgrade cycle | AI Governance Team |
| Routing accuracy | After classifier retraining | Platform Team |
| MCP contract hash | After every MCP server release | Consuming team + MCP team |

**Critical rule:** Baselines must be updated **as part of the deployment process**, not reactively after drift is detected. Reactive baseline updates mask genuine drift.

### 6.3 Drift Detection Schedule

| Check | Frequency | Trigger Also |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Behavioral fingerprint comparison | Daily | On any agent deployment |
| Model canary probe | Daily | On model version change event |
| Embedding neighbor stability | Daily | On embedding model update event |
| MCP contract schema hash | On MCP server deployment | Every 24h |
| A2A capability probe | Every 6 hours | On A2A agent card update event |
| Eval suite regression | On any model/prompt deployment | Weekly full run |
| Memory audit | Weekly sample | On memory anomaly alert |
| Routing accuracy | Hourly | Always (low cost metric) |

## 7. Automatic Rollback Architecture

For Critical and High drift, automatic rollback reduces mean time to recovery:

```
Drift Alert (Critical/High)
        │
        ▼
 [Confirm drift]
 (secondary validation: different detection method)
        │
        ▼
 [Identify rollback target]
 (last known-good version from baseline store)
        │
        ▼
 [Execute rollback]
 (GitOps: ArgoCD reverts to last-known-good agent definition + prompt + model-pin)
        │
        ▼
 [Verify rollback]
 (run canary probes on rolled-back version)
        │
        ▼
 [Notify: Platform team, on-call, stakeholders]
        │
        ▼
 [Post-mortem scheduled within 24h]
```

**Warning:** Automatic rollback requires that **code + prompt + model-pin + policy bundle** are versioned together and rolled back atomically. Partial rollbacks (code only, or prompt only) are a common cause of post-rollback incidents.

# **Architecture Economics & Decision Science**

Putting numbers behind architecture decisions: technical debt valuation, architecture ROI, cost of delay, FinOps, GreenOps, and the formal decision frameworks (ATAM, CBAM, real options, Wardley evolution) that separate principal-level judgment from opinion.

Enterprise Architecture Review Board Handbook · Banking & Financial Services Edition

## **Part A — Architecture Economics**

Most ARBs operate on architectural merit alone — is the design sound, secure, scalable — without a disciplined economic layer underneath. This is a critical gap at the principal level: a CFO or business sponsor doesn't ultimately care whether a design follows hexagonal architecture; they care whether it returns more value than it costs, on a timeline that matters. This part builds the economic vocabulary and quantitative tools a Principal Enterprise Architect needs to hold their own in investment conversations.

### **3.1 Technical Debt Valuation**

Technical debt is frequently discussed qualitatively ("this system is a mess") without being quantified, which makes it impossible to prioritize against other investment demands. Three complementary valuation approaches are used in mature banking architecture practices:

#### **The Interest Rate Model**

Borrowed from Ward Cunningham's original debt metaphor: technical debt accrues "interest" in the form of increased delivery cost on every subsequent change to the affected system. The valuation formula:

###### **FORMULA**

##### **Annual Debt Interest = (Baseline Change Cost × Debt Velocity Multiplier − Baseline Change Cost) × Expected Annual Change Volume**

Where the Debt Velocity Multiplier is empirically derived by comparing story-point or cycle-time estimates for comparable changes in the debt-laden system versus a clean reference system. In practice, banking core systems commonly show multipliers of 1.5x–4x for legacy COBOL/mainframe-adjacent components versus modern equivalents.

#### **The Replacement Cost Model**

Values debt as the delta between the estimated cost to remediate now versus the compounding cost to remediate later, accounting for the fact that debt tends to make surrounding code worse over time (entropy effect). Useful for board-level "why now" arguments, since it directly answers "what does waiting cost us."

#### **The Risk-Adjusted Model**

For regulated banking environments, the most defensible model layers in failure probability and regulatory exposure: **Debt Value = Remediation Cost Avoided + (P(failure) × Cost of Failure) + (P(regulatory finding) × Cost of Finding)** . This is the model that resonates most with Risk Committees because it speaks their native risk-quantification language.

###### **PRACTICAL CAUTION**

Avoid presenting a single precise-looking number (e.g., "$4,217,000 in technical debt") without showing the assumptions. Sophisticated financial stakeholders will (rightly) distrust false precision. Present a range with the driving assumptions visible, the same way the bank would present any other risk-adjusted financial estimate.

### **3.2 Architecture ROI**

Architecture-level ROI differs from project ROI in that the architecture itself is rarely the direct revenue driver — it's an enabler. The standard formula needs adaptation:

|**Component**|**Banking-specific considerations**|
|---|---|
|**Direct cost avoidance**|Reduced infrastructure spend, license consolidation, reduced incident/outage cost|
|**Velocity value**|Faster time-to-market for new products, monetized as opportunity cost of delay (see 3.3) — especially<br>material in competitive product lines like digital lending or payments|
|**Risk-adjusted value**|Reduced regulatory exposure, reduced operational risk capital requirement under Basel-style<br>operational risk frameworks where applicable|
|**Optionality value**|The value of architectural flexibility itself — see Real Options Analysis in Section 4 — frequently the<br>largest and hardest-to-quantify component for platform investments|

### **3.3 Cost of Delay**

Cost of Delay (CoD) reframes "when should we do this" from a gut-feel prioritization exercise into an economic one. The core

insight: delaying a high-value, time-sensitive initiative is itself a cost, even though it never appears on a balance sheet.

###### **CD3 — COST OF DELAY DIVIDED BY DURATION**

The most widely adopted prioritization formula in SAFe and similar scaled-agile banking environments: **CD3 = (User/Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement) ÷ Job Duration** . This produces a weighted-shortest-job-first ranking that a Principal Architect can use to defend backlog sequencing decisions to an Executive Steering Committee in economic terms rather than technical ones.

In banking specifically, Time Criticality is often regulatory-driven (a fixed compliance deadline creates a step-function cost-ofdelay curve rather than a linear one) — this is worth modeling explicitly rather than averaging into a generic score, since a linear CoD model will systematically under-prioritize regulatory deadlines until they become emergencies.

### **3.4 Platform ROI & Cloud ROI**

Platform investments (shared services, internal developer platforms, common data platforms) are notoriously hard to justify because their value is distributed across many consumers rather than concentrated in one P&L. The standard approach in mature banking architecture practices is consumer-weighted attribution:

|**Metric**|**Calculation Approach**|
|---|---|
|Platform adoption rate|% of eligible new initiatives building on the platform vs. building bespoke|
|Time-to-first-value|Median time from platform onboarding to first production use by a new consumer team|
|Marginal cost per additional<br>consumer|Should trend strongly downward as the platform matures — a flat or rising marginal cost signals the platform isn't<br>achieving genuine economies of scale|
|Avoided duplicate build cost|Sum of estimated bespoke-build cost across all consumer teams, had the platform not existed — typically the largest<br>single ROI line item|

Cloud ROI in banking carries additional nuance versus generic enterprise cloud ROI calculations because of the regulatory capital and resilience requirements layered on top of pure infrastructure economics — multi-region/multi-AZ resilience requirements driven by operational resilience regulation (e.g., DORA in the EU) impose cost floors that pure commercial cloud ROI models don't account for, and that gap should be explicit in any cloud business case rather than silently absorbed into "miscellaneous."

### **3.5 AI ROI, Token Economics & GPU Economics**

This is the fastest-evolving area of architecture economics and the one Principal Architects are least likely to have formal training in, since it didn't exist as a discipline before roughly 2023.

#### **Token Economics**

For any architecture incorporating large language models, cost scales with token throughput, not transaction count — a critical distinction from traditional compute economics. Key levers a Principal Architect should model explicitly in any AI-enabled architecture business case:

- **Input vs. output token cost asymmetry** — output tokens typically cost several times more than input tokens across major model providers, which materially affects architecture choices like response length constraints and summarization-beforegeneration patterns

- **Context window cost** — retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architectures trade increased per-call token cost (larger context) against reduced fine-tuning/training cost; this trade-off should be modeled, not assumed

- **Caching economics** — prompt caching can reduce repeated-context costs substantially for architectures with stable system prompts and high call volume; this is frequently the single highest-leverage cost optimization available and is underused in early AI architecture designs

- **Model tiering** — routing simple queries to smaller/cheaper models and complex queries to larger models (a pattern sometimes called a "model router" or "cascade") can reduce blended cost significantly versus a single-model architecture, at the cost of added architectural complexity

#### **GPU Economics**

For banks running self-hosted or fine-tuned models rather than purely consuming third-party APIs, GPU economics become a capacity-planning discipline closer to traditional data center economics, with the added complexity of a global GPU supplydemand market that has been volatile. Key considerations: reserved vs. on-demand vs. spot capacity trade-offs, the depreciation curve of GPU hardware (notably steeper than general-purpose compute given the pace of model-architecture-driven hardware improvements), and the make-vs-buy decision between self-hosted inference and managed API consumption, which should be revisited on a more frequent cycle (semi-annually is reasonable) than traditional infrastructure decisions given how quickly the economics shift.

###### **WHERE AI ROI CALCULATIONS COMMONLY GO WRONG**

Treating AI ROI like traditional automation ROI (headcount hours saved × hourly cost) systematically understates both the upside (quality improvements, new capabilities not previously possible) and the downside (ongoing model cost is recurring and usage-scaling, unlike a one-time automation build cost — and accuracy/hallucination risk carries its own cost-of-failure term that traditional automation ROI models don't have a slot for).

### **3.6 Build vs. Buy**

The classic make-or-buy decision, with banking-specific weighting factors that differ from generic enterprise software:

|**Factor**|**Banking-specific weight**|
|---|---|
|Regulatory/compliance fit|Often dominant — a vendor solution lacking required audit, data residency, or explainability features can be<br>disqualifying regardless of cost advantage|
|Differentiation value|Build where the capability is genuinely differentiating to the bank's competitive position (e.g., proprietary risk<br>models); buy where it's table-stakes infrastructure|
|Vendor concentration risk|Increasingly scrutinized by regulators (third-party/critical-vendor risk regimes such as DORA's critical ICT<br>third-party provider regime) — heavy reliance on a single vendor for a critical capability is itself a risk to be<br>priced in|
|Total cost of ownership horizon|Banking systems frequently run 10-20+ year lifespans; vendor lock-in cost should be modeled over that full<br>horizon, not a 3-5 year contract term|

### **3.7 FinOps**

FinOps brings financial accountability to variable cloud spend through a now well-established maturity model: **Inform** (visibility into spend), **Optimize** (rightsizing, reserved capacity, waste elimination), **Operate** (continuous, automated cost governance embedded in delivery workflows). A Principal Architect's role in FinOps is primarily at the Inform and Optimize layers — ensuring architecture decisions are made with accurate unit economics visibility (cost per transaction, cost per customer, cost per API call) rather than aggregate cloud bills that obscure which architectural decisions are driving cost.

### **3.8 GreenOps, Carbon Footprint & Energy Efficiency**

An increasingly material consideration for banks subject to ESG disclosure requirements and net-zero commitments. Architecture decisions have a measurable carbon footprint, primarily through compute and storage energy consumption, weighted by the carbon intensity of the underlying data center's energy grid.

###### **PRACTICAL LEVERS FOR ARCHITECTS**

- Region selection for cloud workloads, weighting grid carbon intensity alongside latency and regulatory data-residency requirements

- Right-sizing and idle-resource elimination — the single highest-leverage GreenOps action and one that also directly serves FinOps goals, making it an easy joint business case

Workload scheduling to align with lower-carbon-intensity periods on the grid, for non-time-sensitive batch workloads

- AI/ML training and inference carbon cost — increasingly significant and increasingly disclosed by major model providers, worth incorporating into AI architecture decisions explicitly

### **3.9 Developer Productivity Metrics**

Architecture quality is a leading indicator of developer productivity, but the causal link needs measurement discipline to be credible in investment conversations. The DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, mean time to restore) remain the most broadly validated and recognized framework, supplemented increasingly by the SPACE framework (satisfaction, performance, activity, communication, efficiency) for a more holistic view that captures developer experience factors DORA alone misses.

###### **CAUSALITY CAUTION**

A Principal Architect should be careful not to claim direct causality between a specific architecture decision and a DORA metric improvement without controlling for confounding factors (team composition changes, concurrent process changes, seasonal effects). The defensible claim is usually "architecture X is correlated with improvement Y across N comparable teams," not "architecture X caused improvement Y."

### **3.10 Business Capability Value Realization**

The final economic discipline ties everything above back to the business capability model (detailed in Volume 3): for each business capability the architecture serves, value realization tracking should answer whether the promised value in the original business case actually materialized post-implementation. This closing-the-loop discipline — benefits realization tracking — is the single most commonly skipped step in banking architecture economics, and its absence is precisely why architecture investment requests are so often met with skepticism: there's no track record of past promises being checked against outcomes.

## **Part B — Decision Science for Architecture**

Economics tells you what something is worth; decision science tells you how to choose well under uncertainty, competing stakeholder interests, and incomplete information — which describes essentially every consequential architecture decision a Principal Architect will face. This part covers the formal frameworks that elevate architecture decision-making from defensible opinion to structured, repeatable, auditable reasoning.

### **4.1 Decision Frameworks Overview**

No single framework fits every decision. The table below maps decision characteristics to the appropriate framework, which is itself a decision-science skill worth having explicitly.

|**Decision Characteristic**|**Best-Fit Framework**|
|---|---|
|Few clear options, well-understood<br>criteria|Weighted scoring model (4.3)|
|Sequential decisions with branching<br>outcomes|Decision trees (4.2)|
|Quality attribute trade-offs across<br>architecture options|ATAM / CBAM (4.4, 4.5)|
|High uncertainty, option to delay or stage<br>investment|Real options analysis (4.8)|
|Technology lifecycle and market<br>positioning|Wardley mapping (4.9)|
|High-stakes financial/timeline risk<br>modeling|Monte Carlo simulation (4.10)|

### **4.2 Decision Trees**

Decision trees make sequential, conditional architecture decisions explicit and auditable — particularly valuable in regulated banking contexts where "why did we choose this path" needs to be answerable months or years later. A well-formed architecture decision tree captures not just the chosen path but the rejected branches and why, which is precisely the information an Architecture Decision Record (ADR, see Volume 4) should preserve.

###### **WORKED EXAMPLE STRUCTURE**

##### **Decision: Data integration pattern for a new product launch**

Node 1 — Is near-real-time data required?

- → Yes: Node 2a — Is the source system event-capable?

- → Yes: Event streaming (Kafka/equivalent)

- → No: Change Data Capture (CDC)

- → No: Node 2b — Is data volume high (>10M records/batch)?

- → Yes: Bulk ETL with incremental loading

- → No: Scheduled API polling

### **4.3 Weighted Scoring**

The workhorse tool for ARB-level architecture option comparisons. The discipline that separates a credible weighted scoring model from a manipulated one is weight derivation: weights should be set *before* options are scored, ideally by a separate stakeholder group from those scoring the options, to prevent the common (and often unconscious) anti-pattern of reverseengineering weights to justify a pre-determined preferred option.

|**Criterion**|**Weight**|**Option A Score (1-5)**|**Option B Score (1-5)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total cost of ownership (5yr)|25%|3|4|
|Time to delivery|20%|4|2|
|Security & compliance fit|25%|5|3|
|Operational resilience|15%|3|4|
|Team capability fit|15%|4|3|
|**Weighted total**|100%|**3.8**|**3.25**|

###### **LIMITATION TO STATE EXPLICITLY**

Weighted scoring produces a precise-looking number from inherently subjective inputs. Always present the sensitivity of the outcome to weight changes (e.g., "Option A wins under current weights; Option B wins if security weight drops below 18%") rather than presenting the weighted total as if it were objectively derived.

### **4.4 Architecture Fitness Functions**

Borrowed from evolutionary architecture practice (Ford, Parsons, Kua): automated, repeatable tests that verify an architecture continues to exhibit a desired characteristic over time, as opposed to a one-time review verdict. This is the mechanism that closes the architecture-drift gap identified in Volume 1 (Overlap Zone 4).

|**Fitness Function**<br>**Type**|**Example in a Banking Context**|
|---|---|
|Atomic|API response time must stay under 200ms p99|
|Holistic|Combined check that a payments service maintains both latency and data-consistency guarantees together|
|Triggered|Run on every deployment pipeline execution (e.g., dependency vulnerability scan)|
|Continual|Run constantly against production (e.g., real-time architecture conformance monitoring against an approved reference<br>architecture)|

### **4.5 Trade-off Matrices & Quality Attribute Workshops (QAW)**

A Quality Attribute Workshop is a structured stakeholder session (typically facilitated, half-day to full-day) that elicits and prioritizes the quality attribute scenarios a system must satisfy — before architecture design begins, not after. The output is a set of concrete, testable scenarios (e.g., "the payments system must process 5,000 transactions/second with 99.99% availability during peak end-of-month processing") that feed directly into ATAM analysis.

### **4.6 ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method)**

The SEI's formal method for evaluating how well a candidate architecture satisfies its quality attribute requirements, and — critically — surfacing the trade-offs and sensitivity points where improving one quality attribute degrades another. ATAM's core value in a banking ARB context is making implicit trade-offs explicit and documented, which is exactly what regulators and auditors look for when reviewing architecture decisions retrospectively.

###### **ATAM'S NINE STEPS (CONDENSED)**

1. Present the ATAM method · 2. Present business drivers · 3. Present the architecture · 4. Identify architectural approaches · 5. Generate quality attribute utility tree · 6. Analyze architectural approaches against scenarios · 7. Brainstorm and prioritize scenarios with stakeholders · 8. Analyze architectural approaches (round 2) · 9. Present results, including risks, sensitivity points, and trade-off points.

### **4.7 CBAM (Cost Benefit Analysis Method)**

Extends ATAM by attaching dollar values and costs to the architectural decisions ATAM identifies, ranking architectural strategies by ROI rather than just architectural soundness. CBAM is the natural bridge between this volume's two parts — it's where Architecture Economics (Part A) and Decision Science (Part B) formally meet. In practice, very few banking ARBs run full CBAM given its overhead; a pragmatic adaptation is to run full ATAM and then apply lightweight CBAM-style cost/benefit estimation only to the top 2-3 architectural strategies ATAM surfaces as having material trade-offs.

### **4.8 Real Options Analysis**

Treats architectural flexibility as a financial option with calculable value — the right, but not the obligation, to take a future action (scale up, pivot, abandon) given new information. This is the most underused decision science tool in enterprise architecture, despite being arguably the most relevant: it directly addresses the question "how much should we pay today for the ability to change course later," which is exactly the question behind decisions like modular vs. monolithic architecture, multicloud vs. single-cloud, or build-now-vs-defer for emerging AI capabilities.

|**Option Type**|**Architecture Example**|
|---|---|
|Option to defer|Building an abstraction layer now to defer the final choice of payment rail provider until regulatory clarity improves|
|Option to expand|Designing a microservice with capacity headroom and clean scaling boundaries to cheaply expand later if a product takes off|
|Option to<br>abandon|Structuring a vendor contract and integration with clean exit boundaries, valuing the ability to walk away if the vendor<br>underperforms|
|Option to switch|Multi-cloud abstraction layers that preserve the ability to shift workloads between providers as pricing or capability shifts|

###### **WHY THIS IS HARD TO SELL INTERNALLY**

Real options value is, almost by definition, the value of something that might never be used. Finance stakeholders trained on NPV/DCF models can be skeptical of paying a premium today for an option that may expire worthless. The credible framing is insurance, not speculation — and quantifying it using Black-Scholes-derived or binomial option pricing analogues (with architectureappropriate proxies for volatility and time-to-expiry) gives the conversation more rigor than a hand-wavy "flexibility is good" argument.

### **4.9 Wardley Mapping & Evolution**

Simon Wardley's mapping technique plots components of a value chain against their evolutionary stage (Genesis → Custom-Built → Product → Commodity), giving architects a situational-awareness tool for deciding where to build custom, where to buy product, and where to consume commodity/utility services — directly informing the Build vs. Buy decisions in Part A.

###### **BANKING-RELEVANT EVOLUTIONARY OBSERVATIONS**

Core ledger/general ledger capability has moved substantially from Custom-Built toward Product over the past decade (core banking platforms). Payments rail connectivity is increasingly commodity (Banking-as-a-Service, payment orchestration platforms). Generative AI application patterns are, as of 2026, still largely in the Custom-Built to early-Product transition — meaning architecture decisions in this space should expect continued rapid change and should weight optionality (4.8) more heavily than in mature, commoditized areas.

### **4.10 Monte Carlo Risk Simulation**

For architecture decisions with genuine quantifiable uncertainty (capacity planning under variable load, project timeline risk, cost estimation under variable scope), Monte Carlo simulation produces a probability distribution of outcomes rather than a single point estimate — substantially more honest than the single-number estimates that dominate most architecture business cases, and increasingly expected by sophisticated Risk Committees evaluating large technology investments.

###### **MINIMUM VIABLE PRACTICE**

A Principal Architect doesn't need to personally build Monte Carlo models from scratch for every decision — that's disproportionate for most cases. The high-leverage practice is knowing when a decision's stakes and uncertainty warrant it (large capital commitments, regulatory-deadline-critical timelines, capacity decisions with material headroom-vs-cost trade-offs) and partnering with quantitative risk or finance functions who likely already have the tooling and expertise.

### **4.11 Putting It Together — A Decision Science Selection Heuristic**

###### **QUICK REFERENCE FOR CHOOSING A FRAMEWORK UNDER TIME PRESSURE**

**Low stakes, clear options** → weighted scoring, done in under an hour

**High stakes, quality-attribute-driven** → QAW followed by ATAM

**High stakes, financially material** → ATAM followed by CBAM, or full Monte Carlo if uncertainty is the dominant factor **High uncertainty, staged investment possible** → Real options framing, even if not fully formally priced

**Build vs. buy, market-positioning questions** → Wardley mapping as the first lens, before economics

The discipline of explicitly naming which framework you're using — even informally, in an ADR — is itself valuable: it forces the decision-maker to be honest about what kind of decision this actually is, rather than defaulting to gut feel dressed up as analysis.

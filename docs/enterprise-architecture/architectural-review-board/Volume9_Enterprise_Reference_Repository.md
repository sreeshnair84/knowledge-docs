# Part A — Reference Architectures & Architecture Patterns

The goal of this repository is practical reuse, not comprehensive coverage. Every entry has been selected because it represents a decision a Principal Architect in a banking context will genuinely face — not because it completes a theoretical taxonomy. Entries include what the pattern solves, its key trade-offs, when to avoid it, and a Mermaid diagram specification for versioncontrolled documentation.

#### USING MERMAID DIAGRAMS IN LIVING DOCUMENTATION

All diagrams in this volume are specified in **Mermaid** syntax, which can be rendered directly in Confluence, GitHub/GitLab, and most modern documentation platforms. This means the diagram lives as version-controlled text alongside ADRs and architecture records, rather than as a binary image file disconnected from its source — the living-documentation discipline from Volume 3, Section 5.8, applied concretely.

## RA-01 — Event-Driven Core Banking Integration

**Problem:** Core banking platforms (Temenos, Finacle, FIS Profile, custom mainframe) are typically synchronous, monolithic, and intolerant of the fan-out integration demands that a modern digital bank imposes — mobile app, open banking APIs, real-time analytics, fraud detection, regulatory reporting, all needing to react to account events in near-real-time.

**Solution:** Introduce an event streaming backbone (Apache Kafka or cloud-native equivalent) as a mediator between the core and downstream consumers. The core emits domain events (AccountDebited, LoanStatusChanged, CustomerKYCUpdated) and each consumer subscribes independently — no direct coupling between consumers, and the core is insulated from demand spikes on any downstream system.

|**Trade-**<br>**off**|**Detail**|
|---|---|
|Gained|Decoupling; downstream scalability independent of core; natural audit trail (the event log itself is immutable); fan-out without core<br>performance impact|
|Lost|Eventual consistency — consumers see events with a small lag, which is unacceptable for some use cases (e.g., real-time payment status<br>checks by the customer must be handled with care; see RA-03 for CQRS complement)|
|Avoid<br>when|The bank has very low event volume and the integration complexity of a broker outweighs its benefits; or when regulatory requirements<br>demand synchronous confirmation of every downstream reaction to every event|

## RA-02 — Strangler Fig for Core Banking Modernization

**Problem:** Replacing a legacy core banking platform in a single cutover (the "big bang" approach) carries catastrophic operational risk — the number of major bank outages attributable to failed big-bang cutovers is a significant data point — but allowing the legacy to persist indefinitely also has compounding costs.

**Solution:** The Strangler Fig pattern routes new capability requests to modern implementations while existing functionality remains on the legacy system, migrating capability-by-capability with each iteration gradually shrinking the legacy's footprint until it can be safely retired. The routing layer (often an API gateway or a specialized "façade" service) is the key architectural element.

|**Trade-**<br>**off**|**Detail**|
|---|---|
|Gained|Risk distributed across many small increments rather than concentrated in one cutover; ability to validate each migrated capability in<br>production before the next; legacy system provides fallback at every stage|
|Lost|Extended dual-running cost — the bank runs both systems in parallel for the migration duration, which can be 3-7+ years for a full core<br>banking migration; the routing facade itself becomes a technical debt item that must eventually be retired|
|Avoid|The legacy system is so deeply intertwined that clean capability boundaries cannot be established without a foundational redesign first —|
|when|in this case, a bounded decomposition exercise must precede the strangler pattern|

## RA-03 — CQRS for Regulatory Reporting at Scale

**Problem:** Regulatory reporting in banking (prudential, liquidity, AML, transaction monitoring) requires complex, timeconsuming aggregations over large datasets that, if run against the transactional database, impose unacceptable performance impact on the write path — and the reporting data model is often radically different from the transactional one.

**Solution:** Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) separates the write model (transactional commands) from read models (optimized for regulatory reporting queries), with the read model updated asynchronously from the write model via the event stream from RA-01. Multiple specialized read models can coexist, each optimized for a different reporting shape.

|**Trade-**<br>**off**|**Detail**|
|---|---|
|Gained|Read model can be independently scaled; report queries no longer compete with payment processing for database resources; read models<br>can be purpose-built for regulatory report schemas, removing complex runtime transformations|
|Lost|Eventual consistency on the read side (reports reflect data as of last event, not necessarily real-time); operational complexity of<br>maintaining read model synchronization and reconciliation when events are missed or replayed|
|Avoid<br>when|Reports must reflect exact-to-the-second transactional state — in this case the consistency cost of CQRS is unacceptable and a read<br>replica of the transactional store may be more appropriate|

## RA-04 — Saga Pattern for Distributed Payment Flows

**Problem:** A payment initiation in a modern banking architecture typically spans multiple services (authorization, fraud check, AML screening, ledger posting, notification) with no single database that all services share. A failure in any step must not leave the system in a partially-completed state that can't be reconciled.

**Solution:** The Saga pattern manages a distributed multi-step transaction as a sequence of local transactions, each of which publishes an event consumed by the next step. If any step fails, compensating transactions are executed in reverse to undo prior steps' effects — preserving data consistency without a distributed transaction coordinator.

|**sequenceDiagram**|
|---|
|**PaymentService->>FraudService: CheckFraud(paymentId)**|
|**FraudService-->>PaymentService: FraudCheckPassed**|
|**PaymentService->>AMLService: ScreenTransaction(paymentId)**|
|**AMLService-->>PaymentService: AMLClear**|
|**PaymentService->>LedgerService: PostDebit(accountId, amount)**|
|**LedgerService-->>PaymentService: DebitPosted**|
|**PaymentService->>NotifyService: SendConfirmation(customerId)**<br>**Note over PaymentService: On failure at any step, compensating txns reverse prior steps**|

## RA-05 — API Gateway with Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) for Omnichannel Banking

**Problem:** Mobile banking, web banking, branch systems, and open-banking third-party channels all consume overlapping but not identical data, at different payload sizes, with different latency tolerances and authentication requirements. A single generic API layer forces every channel to work around mismatches between their needs and the API's shape.

**Solution:** An API gateway handles cross-cutting concerns (authentication, rate limiting, SSL termination) while channel-specific Backend-for-Frontend services handle the composition, transformation, and aggregation each channel needs — the mobile BFF returns a lightweight, mobile-optimized payload; the web BFF returns a richer dataset; the open-banking BFF enforces regulatory protocol requirements (PSD2-equivalent).

## RA-06 — Zero-Trust Network Architecture for Payment Processing Environments

**Problem:** Traditional perimeter-based security assumes that traffic inside the network boundary is trustworthy — a model that has been demonstrated repeatedly as insufficient in modern banking environments where sophisticated adversaries routinely achieve perimeter access and then move laterally with minimal additional friction.

**Solution:** Zero-trust treats every connection request as potentially hostile regardless of origin, requiring explicit verification (identity, device posture, intent) for every access request, minimum-privilege authorization scoped to the specific action requested, and continuous monitoring of in-session behavior rather than a one-time authentication event.

## RA-07 — AI Model Gateway / Router Pattern

**Problem:** An enterprise banking organization deploying AI features across multiple products faces vendor concentration risk (dependence on a single AI provider), cost optimization opportunities (routing simple queries to cheaper models), and resilience requirements (failover if a provider has an outage) — none of which are well-handled by direct, point-to-point integration with a single AI model API in each product.

**Solution:** A model gateway sits between consuming services and AI model providers, handling routing, rate limiting, cost tracking, provider failover, and response caching. A routing policy engine directs queries based on complexity, cost envelope, latency requirements, and data-sensitivity classification (some queries must not leave approved providers due to data residency requirements).

## RA-08 — Customer 360 Data Product

**Problem:** Customer data in a typical large bank is fragmented across dozens of systems — core banking, CRM, loan origination, mobile app, card systems, wealth management — with no single, curated, authoritative view. Downstream systems (fraud detection, personalization, regulatory reporting, customer service) each maintain their own partial views, creating inconsistency, duplication, and significant data quality risk.

**Solution:** A Customer 360 data product (Volume 3, Part B) aggregates, reconciles, and exposes a curated, versioned, SLAbacked customer view as a reusable data product rather than a point-to-point integration. Ownership, quality, and freshness are explicit — the product has a named owner, a defined quality contract, and observable freshness metrics.

## RA-09 — Agentic AI with Human-in-the-Loop for KYC Remediation

**Problem:** KYC (Know Your Customer) remediation — identifying and resolving gaps in customer due diligence records — is a labor-intensive process typically handled by operations teams manually reviewing thousands of records against document and data requirements. It is highly repetitive, yet the consequences of errors (regulatory exposure, financial crime risk) are severe enough that full automation without oversight is inappropriate.

**Solution:** An AI agent handles the high-volume, well-defined portion of the remediation workflow (identifying gaps, retrieving available data, drafting outreach to customers, pre-populating forms) with human reviewers handling exception cases and final authorization decisions. The agent specification (Volume 4, Section 7.5) explicitly defines the boundary: agent acts autonomously up to drafting/staging; human approves before any customer-facing action or record modification.

## AP-01 through AP-15 — Architecture Pattern Catalog

|**ID**|**Pattern**|**Problem solved**|**Key trade-off**|
|---|---|---|---|
|AP-01|Circuit Breaker|Prevents cascading failure when a downstream<br>service is degraded|Adds false-positive risk: circuit opens under transient<br>load and blocks valid traffic|
|AP-02|Bulkhead|Isolates resource pools so failure in one<br>consumer doesn't exhaust resources for others|Adds resource overhead: dedicated pools are less<br>efficient than shared|
|AP-03|Retry with Exponential<br>Backoff|Recovers from transient failures without<br>overloading the failing service|Retry storms under correlated failure; must combine<br>with jitter|
|AP-04|Idempotency Keys|Makes payment and state-changing operations<br>safe to retry without double-processing|Requires idempotency store with appropriate<br>retention; adds latency for key lookup|
|AP-05|Outbox Pattern|Guarantees exactly-once event publishing even<br>when the event broker is temporarily<br>unavailable|Polling overhead; outbox table becomes a bottleneck<br>at very high throughput|
|AP-06|Event Sourcing|Preserves the full history of state changes as an<br>immutable event log — strong audit trail|Query complexity; event schema evolution is hard;<br>eventual consistency for read models|
|AP-07|Sidecar|Attaches operational concerns (logging, mTLS,<br>configuration) to service instances without<br>modifying service code|Adds per-instance resource overhead; complexity of<br>keeping sidecar and service in sync|
|AP-08|API Versioning via Content<br>Negotiation|Allows API evolution without breaking existing<br>consumers|Multiple active versions create maintenance burden;<br>requires disciplined consumer migration strategy|
|AP-09|Data Mesh / Domain<br>Ownership|Shifts data product ownership to domain teams,<br>improving quality accountability|Federated ownership increases data governance<br>coordination cost; risk of inconsistent standards|
|AP-10|RBAC + ABAC Hybrid<br>Authorization|Role-based access for coarse-grained control,<br>attribute-based for fine-grained (e.g., access<br>rules varying by customer segment or product)|Policy complexity grows quickly; authorization service<br>becomes a critical path dependency|
|AP-11|Feature Flags / Dark<br>Launching|Decouples deployment from release; enables<br>gradual rollout and instant rollback|Technical debt accumulates if flags are not cleaned<br>up; flag sprawl makes behavior hard to reason about|
|AP-12|Prompt Caching|Reduces LLM API cost for calls sharing a<br>common system prompt by caching the prompt<br>context server-side|Only effective when prompt prefix is stable; cached<br>context can become stale if the cached portion<br>contains dynamic content|
|AP-13|RAG (Retrieval-Augmented<br>Generation)|Grounds LLM responses in enterprise<br>knowledge without fine-tuning; enables up-to-<br>date answers from a curated knowledge base|Retrieval quality ceiling determines answer quality;<br>hallucination risk on retrieved context; access control<br>on retrieval must mirror source system controls|
|AP-14|Competing Consumers|Scales event/message processing horizontally by<br>running multiple consumer instances against a<br>single queue|Message ordering not guaranteed across consumers;<br>requires idempotent processing (AP-04)|
|AP-15|Transactional Outbox + Inbox|Implements reliable exactly-once message<br>delivery end-to-end across producer and<br>consumer without a distributed transaction|Two additional tables and polling overhead; latency<br>marginally higher than at-most-once delivery|

|---|---|---|---|
|ANT-<br>01|Distributed Monolith|Services are deployed separately but share a<br>database or call each other synchronously for every<br>operation, giving the worst of both worlds:<br>deployment complexity without loose coupling|Missing domain boundary design; remedy is<br>proper bounded context decomposition before<br>decomposing deployment|

|ANT-<br>03|Shared Mutable Database|Multiple services write to a single shared schema,<br>creating implicit coupling through the database layer<br>that defeats the purpose of service boundaries|Short-cut taken to avoid API design effort; each<br>service must own its data and expose it through a<br>defined interface|

## ADR Examples

#### ADR-001 — ADOPT APACHE KAFKA AS ENTERPRISE EVENT STREAMING BACKBONE

**Date:** [Date]  | **Status:** Accepted  | **Deciders:** Chief Architect, Domain Architects, CTO Council

**Context:** The enterprise currently uses point-to-point synchronous integration between core banking, mobile banking, fraud detection, and regulatory reporting systems. This creates tight coupling, limits downstream system scale independence, and requires every new integration to be separately negotiated with the core banking platform team. We need an integration backbone that decouples producers from consumers, supports replay for new consumer onboarding, and provides a durable audit log of domain events.

**Decision:** We will adopt Apache Kafka (managed via [cloud provider] MSK / Confluent Cloud) as the enterprise event streaming backbone for domain events. All teams producing or consuming domain events will do so through this backbone rather than point-topoint.

### Options considered:

Option A: Kafka/Confluent Cloud — strong ecosystem, proven at banking scale, managed offering reduces operational burden. Selected.

Option B: [Cloud provider native] — lower operational overhead, tighter cloud integration, but higher vendor lock-in risk given multicloud strategy.

Option C: RabbitMQ — mature, simpler, but lacks Kafka's log retention/replay model which is required for new consumer onboarding and audit trail use cases.

**Consequences — positive:** Decoupling of core banking from downstream consumers; replay capability for new consumers; durable audit log; scales downstream systems independently.

**Consequences — negative:** Kafka operational expertise required; introduces eventual consistency that teams must design for explicitly; a new critical infrastructure component requiring high-availability design and operational runbooks.

**Compliance notes:** Event data at rest will be encrypted; PII in events must be tokenized per Data Governance policy; event retention periods set per regulatory requirement by topic classification.

#### ADR-002 — USE CQRS FOR REGULATORY REPORTING READ MODELS

**Date:** [Date]  | **Status:** Accepted  | **Deciders:** Domain Architect (Regulatory Reporting), Data Architect

**Context:** Regulatory reporting queries against the transactional database are causing performance degradation during monthend/quarter-end processing windows. The regulatory report data model is materially different from the transactional model, and each report type requires different aggregations. Adding indexes to the transactional database creates DML slowdowns on the payment processing write path.

**Decision:** Implement CQRS with purpose-built read models for the three highest-volume regulatory report types (LCR, NSFR, and AML transaction monitoring feeds). Read models will be maintained via consumption of domain events from the Kafka backbone (ADR-001).

**Consequences — positive:** Zero contention with transactional write path; read models optimized for their specific report schema; can independently scale report-generation infrastructure during peak periods.

**Consequences — negative:** Eventual consistency — reports reflect data as of last event processing, with SLA of [X minutes] lag. Reconciliation process required for end-of-day regulatory submissions to validate read model completeness. Additional operational complexity for read model rebuild on schema change.

#### ADR-003 — AGENT SPECIFICATION: KYC REMEDIATION AGENT SCOPE OF AUTONOMY

**Date:** [Date]  | **Status:** Accepted  | **Deciders:** AI Solution Architect, Compliance Lead, ARB

**Context:** The KYC Remediation Agent (RA-09) requires a formally documented scope of autonomy as a governance prerequisite for ARB and AI Governance Board approval. This ADR captures the authority boundaries that the Agent Specification (Volume 4 Section 7.5) formalizes for this specific agent.

### Decision — Permitted autonomous actions (no human approval required per action):

- Read-only access to customer record system to identify KYC gaps

- Cross-reference external data sources (credit bureau, sanctions lists) for gap resolution candidates

- Draft remediation action items and customer outreach messages (staging only, not sending)

- Categorize customers into remediation priority tiers

### Decision — Requires human approval before execution:

- Any customer-facing communication

- Any write to the customer record system

- Any recommendation to exit a customer relationship (flag for compliance review)

- Any case above defined complexity threshold (agent confidence score below 0.75 on remediation path)

**Consequences:** Human review remains in the critical path for all consequential actions, preserving regulatory accountability. Agent delivers value through throughput improvement on the screening and preparation steps, which represent approximately 70% of current operations team time per case.

#### ADR-004 — REJECT GRAPHQL FEDERATION IN FAVOUR OF REST BFF FOR OPEN BANKING

**Date:** [Date]  | **Status:** Accepted (option rejected documented here)

**Context:** The open banking channel team proposed adopting GraphQL Federation as the API layer for third-party provider (TPP) integration under PSD2-equivalent regulation. The proposal argued that GraphQL's flexibility would reduce per-TPP integration cost.

**Decision:** Rejected. Adopt REST BFF pattern (RA-05) instead.

### Rationale for rejection:

1. Open banking regulatory standards (PSD2 and successors) specify REST/OpenAPI as the required interface standard. GraphQL does not meet this regulatory interface requirement.

2. Introspection of GraphQL schemas exposes internal data model details to third parties beyond what is required or appropriate.

3. Rate limiting and cost-per-query are materially harder to enforce precisely on GraphQL versus REST, which is important for TPP access tier enforcement.

**This ADR is recorded to prevent re-proposal** without new information addressing these constraints, which have been recurring in informal design discussions.

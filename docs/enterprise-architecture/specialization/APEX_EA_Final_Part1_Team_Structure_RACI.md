# APEX EA Part 1: Team Structure, RACI & Operating Model

*This is Part 1 of the [APEX: AI Platform of Platforms EA Blueprint](./APEX_EA_Final.md) series — see the [series index](./APEX_EA_Final.md) for the full programme overview and all parts.*

## APEX Operating Model — Who Does What

The APEX programme operates a federated model: a Platform Core Team builds and runs the shared infrastructure; Domain Squads build and operate agents within it; Governance Bodies provide oversight and approval authority; and Specialist Functions (Security, Compliance, Data) provide embedded expertise throughout the lifecycle. Group CTO Steering Committee TIER 0 — EXEC Executive Sponsor Monthly Oversight Architecture Board Chief AI Ethics Officer Compliance Lead TIER 1 — GOVERN ARB — Weekly AI Risk & Ethics

### Team Interaction & Dependency Map

The following matrix shows how each team tier interacts with others, the nature of the dependency, and the formal channel for that interaction.

| From fi To | Platform Core Team | Domain Squads | ARB / Governance | Specialist Functions | External Stakeholders |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Core Team | Internal: sprint reviews, platform roadmap sync | Provides: infrastructure, tooling, self-service portal, CI/CD pipeline, guardrails | Reports to: ARB weekly; steering monthly. Seeks: approval for SBBs and deviations | Consults: Security (each phase), Data (KB design), Model Risk (agent risk) | Cloud provider SLA management; AWS PS engagement for AI/ML |

| From fi To | Platform Core Team | Domain Squads | ARB / Governance | Specialist Functions | External Stakeholders |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain Squads | Consumes: platform services, agent templates, portal, pipeline. Raises: new agent requests, escalations | Internal: daily standups, shared domain backlog, cross-domain agent dependency reviews | Reports to: Domain ARB. Seeks: architecture approval, compliance sign-off per agent | Consults: Domain Architect (daily), Compliance (per agent intake), Data Steward (data flows) | Business stakeholder demos; UAT with end users |
| ARB / Governance | Approves: architecture decisions, SBBs, deviations, phase gate exits | Reviews: agent blueprints, domain architecture artefacts, compliance evidence | Internal: ARB weekly chair + secretariat. Escalates: to Steering Committee for T5 items | Receives: security review (CISO gate), compliance opinion (T4 Reg-Gate), Model Risk opinion | Regulator liaison via Compliance Lead; quarterly briefings |
| Specialist Functions | Embedded in: security design, data architecture, CI/CD gates | Provides: domain-level guidance, data classification, embedded model risk reviews | Feeds into: ARB with specialist opinions. Attends: relevant ARB agenda items | Cross-functional: security–compliance alignment; data–model risk alignment | No direct external engagement; all via Compliance Lead or CISO |
| External Stakeholders | Receives: SLA reports, FinOps dashboards, compliance packs | None (no direct domain team interaction) | Attends: quarterly regulator briefing.

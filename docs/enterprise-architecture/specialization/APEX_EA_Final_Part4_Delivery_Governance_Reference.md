# APEX EA Part 4: Delivery, Governance & Reference

*Continues from [Part 3: Information Systems & Technology Architecture](./APEX_EA_Final_Part3_Information_Systems_Technology_Architecture.md).*

## Opportunities, Migration, Governance & Change (Phases E–H)

PHASES E–H Roadmap, SBBs, 5-tier governance, and change intelligence

### Architecture Roadmap — ROAD-APEX-001

| Work Package | WP | Bolt s | Wks | Horizo n | Risk Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-region Kubernetes, zero-trust IAM, HashiCorp Vault, network policy | WP-00 1 | 2 | 4 | H1 | Low — well-understood pattern; IaC-automated |
| AI Agent Orchestration platform: framework spike, guardrails, KB-001 | WP-00 2 | 2 | 4 | H1 | Medium — framework lock-in risk; abstraction layer required |
| CI/CD L1–L5 verification + DEA generation service deployment | WP-00 3 | 2 | 3 | H1 | Medium — DEA service is new pattern; allow spike time in bolt 1 |
| Security baseline: zero-trust, mTLS, guardrails layer, Agent Gateway | WP-00 4 | 2 | 4 | H1 | Low — automated; well-understood pattern |
| LGTM observability stack + agent health score metrics + alerting | WP-00 5 | 1 | 2 | H1 | Low |
| Pioneer 1 — Risk Scoring Agent (first full end-to-end; all gates) | WP-00 6 | 3 | 8 | H1 | HIGH — first end-to-end run; DEA, Model Risk, RAGAS all first-time; allow buffer |
| Pioneer 2 — Customer Verification Agent | WP-00 7 | 3 | 7 | H1 | Medium — builds on Pioneer 1 learnings; pattern established |
| Pioneer 3 — Advisory Rebalancing Agent [Programme Risk Gate] | WP-00 8 | 2 | 6 | H2 | Medium — MiFID II HITL adds complexity; suitability rules in KB-003 |
| Pioneer 4 — IT Incident Response Agent | WP-00 9 | 2 | 5 | H2 | Low — operational domain; fewer regulatory constraints |
| Pioneer 5 — Model Monitoring & Compliance Agent | WP-01 0 | 3 | 6 | H2 | Medium — DORA reporting integration; cross-domain data access |
| Self-service portal, agent marketplace, agent health dashboard | WP-01 1 | 3 | 8 | H2 | Medium — developer experience is subjective; UX validation needed |
| EU AI Act compliance pack + DEA template library + DORA automation | WP-01 2 | 2 | 5 | H2 | High — regulatory interpretation risk; regulatory counsel required |

### Migration Strategy — Existing AI Tool Inventory (IMP-APEX-001)

23 pre-existing AI tools were assessed against APEX capability and governance fit, and sorted into four migration categories:

| Category | Count | Action | AI-DLC Migration Path | Target Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ADOPT — Already AWS; add APEX governance | 8 tools | Wrap in APEX tool framework; add guardrails | AI-DLC Operations: IaC wrapping in 1 bolt per tool | Q3 2025 |
| ADAPT — Works well; needs APEX integration layer | 6 tools | Expose as APEX tool; APEX orchestrates | AI-DLC build adapter Lambda in Mob Construction | Q4 2025 |
| REPLACE — Duplicates APEX capability | 7 tools | Pioneer agent replaces; decommission legacy | Parallel-run then canary cutover; AI monitors metrics | Q1 2026 |
| RETIRE — Unused/low value | 2 tools | Immediate decommission; archive audit logs | AI-DLC Operations: IaC teardown + evidence generation | Q2 2025 |

### 5-Tier Governance Model — CAF-APEX-001

| Tier | Scope | Method | SLA | Bypassable? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 — Auto | IaC L1 scan; RAGAS score; DEA completeness; tag compliance; budget alert | CI pipeline + Kubernetes admission controllers + scheduled validation jobs | Synchronous | NO — pipeline physically blocks; no human override path |
| T2 — Architect | Pattern conformance; new data flow; data classification audit | Automated flag fi architect on-call (Slack/Teams) within 4-hour SLA | 4 business hours | NO — deployment blocked until architect approves |
| T3 — ARB | New SBB; significant deviation; agent topology change; debt threshold breach | Weekly ARB session; async for urgent items between sessions | Weekly | Exception ONLY: Group CTO written approval + compliance register entry; silent bypass is not possible |
| T4 — Reg-Gate | High-Risk AI (EU AI Act Art.6); DORA-reportable change; any C4-data flow change | Compliance Lead; no delegation; Regulatory Affairs Lead engaged | 48 hours | NO — hardcoded in CI pipeline; no exception pathway exists |
| T5 — Exec | Budget above approved threshold; strategic architecture change; programme risk escalation | Monthly Steering Committee; emergency session within 48 hrs for DORA incidents | Monthly | NO — requires Steering Committee quorum |

### Change Intelligence Process — ACHG-APEX-001

| Change Type | AI Monitoring | Human Decision Authority | DORA Framing | Illustrative Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 — Techno logy-driven | Model release channels monitored; OSS project feeds; benchmark auto-run vs. GlobalCorp eval suite | Enterprise Architect reviews impact; ARB approves; T4 Reg-Gate if High-Risk agent affected | Formal change event regardless of model release frequency | Open-weight model outperforms current by 18%; ARB approves upgrade in 3 days with RAGAS regression evidence |
| T2 — Regulat ory-driven | Regulatory feed parsed daily by compliance-monitoring agent; impact classified against APEX control inventory | Compliance Lead decides; Regulatory Affairs Lead engaged for ambiguous interpretation | Regulatory change triggers controlled response plan; not reactive patching | EU AI Act Art.6 enforcement date reached; APEX intake auto-classification activated; DORA evidence pack updated same day |
| T3 — Busine ss-driven | Onboarding request submitted via self-service portal; intake workflow triggered automatically | ARB intake decision within 5 business days; architecture review within 10 business days | Standard change; ARB record created; DORA log entry if affects Tier-1 service | New Procurement Division requests APEX onboarding for contract analysis use case |
| T4 — Simplification | Usage analytics flags agents below utilisation threshold for 3 consecutive months; auto-review prompt generated | Domain owner decides: decommission or document justification for retention | Decommission = formal change event; IaC teardown + DEA archive + compliance record | Pioneer 1 v1.2 superseded by v2.0; v1.2 parallel-run for 4 weeks then decommissioned with full evidence trail |

## Requirements Management — Continuous

## Glossary

**SBB** Solution Building Block — specific implementation of an Architecture Building Block; defines what is built, bought, or reused for a given platform capability.

**Semantic Context** AI-DLC concept: rich, structured context provided to AI coding agents through steering files so they apply GlobalCorp-specific standards automatically and consistently.

**TLPT** Threat-Led Penetration Testing — DORA Art.26 obligation for major entities; GlobalCorp APEX conducts TLPT quarterly for the agent gateway and core platform components.

**Unit of Work** AI-DLC equivalent of an Agile Epic; decomposed into bolts. APEX planning baseline: 1 Unit of Work for a Pioneer Domain agent = 3 bolts, 6–8 calendar weeks including governance gates.

**Zero-Trust** Security model where no identity or network location is inherently trusted; every request is authenticated, authorised, and logged regardless of origin; enforced by service mesh mTLS.

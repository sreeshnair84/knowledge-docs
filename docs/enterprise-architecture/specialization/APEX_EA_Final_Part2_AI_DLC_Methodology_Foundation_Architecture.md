# APEX EA Part 2: AI-DLC Methodology & Foundation Architecture

*Continues from [Part 1: Team Structure, RACI & Operating Model](./APEX_EA_Final_Part1_Team_Structure_RACI.md).*

## AI-DLC: Methodology, Phases & EA Impacts

### What is AI-DLC?

The AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) was introduced by AWS in July 2025 and featured at AWS re:Invent 2025. It emerged from 100+ enterprise experiments and observed that AI-assisted (too narrow) and AI-autonomous (too unreliable) both produced suboptimal results. AI-DLC positions AI as a central collaborator throughout every development activity — design, build, test, deploy, and operate.

#### Proven Results

Enterprise adopters report 2–5× sustainable productivity gains across the full lifecycle. In well-scoped greenfield tasks with high-quality semantic context, gains reach 7–10×. Teams using AI-DLC consistently report improved code quality alongside velocity: the Qodo 2025 report showed quality improvements rising from 55% to 81% with AI-assisted review; the Atlassian RovoDev 2026 study found AI code review comments led to additional fixes in 38.7% of cases.

| Ph ase | Name | AI Role | Human Role | Architecture Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | INCEPTION (Mob Elaboration) | Transforms business intent into structured requirements, user stories, capability maps, and architecture units at speed | Validates AI outputs; provides business context, domain knowledge, and political nuance that AI cannot infer | Vision, requirements, and capability maps produced in days not weeks; must be preceded by a political context capture session |
| 2 | CONSTRUCTIO N (Mob Construction) | Proposes architecture components, generates IaC, writes serverless functions, builds tests from semantic context | Clarifies technical decisions and architectural choices in real time; reviews every AI-generated artefact before merge | Phases B/C/D produced concurrently in bolts; concurrent execution requires

**Phase Boundary Receipt**s for regulated data flows |
| 3 | OPERATIONS | Applies accumulated context to IaC deployment, canary monitoring, incident pattern recognition, and drift detection | Reviews and approves all changes; monitors SLOs; makes judgment calls in novel failure scenarios | Phases F/G/H compressed into continuous delivery; every AI-driven change is a formal DORA change event with ARB record |

### Terminology Reference — AI-DLC vs. Traditional

| Traditional Term | AI-DLC Term | Duration Change | Enterprise Architecture Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sprint | Bolt | 2–4 weeks fi hours to days | ADM governance must operate within bolt cadence; tiered model required |
| Epic | Unit of Work | Months fi days to weeks | Architecture work packages shrink; ARB meets weekly not bi-weekly |
| User Story | AI-Elaborated Requirement | Days fi minutes | Requirements traceability automated; ARS auto-updated with human review gate |
| Architecture Review | Real-time

**Mob Construction** | Weeks fi concurrent | ARB provides real-time guidance; final sign-off authority retained |
| Documentation | Persistent

**Semantic Context** | Post-sprint fi continuous | Architecture repository auto-updated; EA team shifts from authors to reviewers |
| Code Review (PR) | AI-Augmented Quality Scan | Hours fi minutes | L1–L5 Layered Verification Model enforced in pipeline; no hero review |
| Retrospective | Continuous Learning Loop | End of sprint fi continuous | Architecture debt auto-detected; agent health scoring continuous |

### AI-DLC Impact Across All 10 TOGAF ADM Phases

| TOGAF Phase | AI-DLC Capability | Human Guard Required | Architecture Adaptation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preliminary | AI generates architecture principle drafts; governance rules codified as steering files | Architects validate all AI-generated principles; formal ratification gate mandatory | Steering files maintained in version control; breaking changes require architect approval |
| Phase A — Vision | AI transforms business intent into draft Architecture Vision and

**SAW**in hours | Political nuance, power dynamics, and unwritten constraints require human capture before

**Mob Elaboration** | Political Blindspot Protocol precedes every Mob Elaboration session |
| Phase B — Business | AI auto-generates business capability maps from existing documentation; value streams modelled in minutes | Existing documents may be stale; Data Maturity Gate required before AI elaboration begins | Data Maturity Gate: 5-check assessment mandatory before Phase B AI execution |
| Phase C — Data | AI creates data models, entity diagrams, and API schemas; prompt catalogs and embeddings become first-class governed entities | Embedding model upgrades require

**Embedding Compatibility** Contract and

**RAGAS**regression gate | Embeddings versioned; RAGAS gate on model upgrade; 90-day rollback window maintained |
| Phase C — Application | AI proposes application component models and cloud-native integration patterns | AI may propose patterns inconsistent with org standards without tight steering files | Org standards loaded as steering files; all AI-proposed patterns reviewed by ARB |
| Phase D — Technology | AI generates IaC, security policies, and deployment configs from architecture context | AI-generated IaC requires L1–L5 Layered Verification; IaC hallucinations are a real risk | L1–L5 Layered Verification Model enforced in CI/CD; no merge without engineer confirmation |
| Phase E — Opportunities | AI analyses gap reports and proposes build/buy/reuse options at machine speed | AI may miss regulatory obligations, vendor relationship context, and political constraints | Legal, procurement, and compliance participate in Mob Elaboration for all build/buy decisions |
| Phase F — Migration | Bolts replace work packages; migration plans near-real-time | Over-acceleration may skip governance gates | Compliance gates pipeline-enforced; AI-DLC speed contained within governance boundaries |
| Phase G — Governance | AI automates conformance checking; real-time drift detection replaces periodic reviews | Automated checks inform; humans decide; ARB retains final sign-off authority | 5-tier governance model; T1 automated always-on; T4 Reg-Gate inviolable |
| Phase H — Change | AI monitors model releases and regulatory changes; flags architecture impacts automatically | Continuous change proposals require human filtering to avoid architecture instability | Change type classification; AI flags; humans prioritise; DORA change framing applied to all AI changes |
| Req. Management | AI generates and maintains requirements traceability from business intent to deployed code | Context drift across sessions; requirements must be forward-traced before each deployment | Context Integrity Protocol; session summary archive; forward-trace validation per deployment |

### Operating Model Transformations Required

AI-DLC is not just a development methodology — it requires structural changes to the enterprise architecture operating model. Research from Intelance, Staun & Stender, and CIO.com (2025) identifies five critical transformation areas GlobalCorp must address:

**1. Governance Tempo: From Quarterly to Near Real-Time** — Traditional EA governance operates on quarterly review cycles. AI-DLC's "bolt" cadence means architecture decisions are needed in hours. GlobalCorp must establish a tiered governance model: automated checks run continuously (Cat A/B compliance), architect-in-the-loop reviews occur daily, full ARB convenes weekly rather than bi-weekly. Research from Staun & Stender (2025) confirms that "these are not quarterly review topics; they are near real-time decisions."

**2. EA Artefacts: From Static Documents to Living Digital Twins** — Gartner (2025) notes that Forrester identified AI agents in EA suites are now automating data validation, capability mapping, and artefact creation. GlobalCorp's architecture repository (LeanIX) must transition from a periodic-update model to a continuously auto-updated environment where AI-DLC tools write back architecture artefacts as they are generated. The EA team shifts from artefact authors to artefact reviewers.

**3. New Roles: Enterprise AI Architect & Chief AI Ethics Officer** — BCG research found that 89% of C-level executives ranked AI/GenAI in their top three strategic priorities for 2024. In response, organisations are introducing dedicated roles such as the Enterprise AI Architect. GlobalCorp must create this role (filled internally from the APEX Architecture team) and formalise the Chief AI Ethics Officer position proposed in the APEX Business Architecture.

**4. Data Architecture Extension: AI-Native Entities** — TOGAF's traditional data architecture covers conceptual, logical, and physical models. AI-DLC introduces new first-class data entities that must be governed: **embeddings** (versioned vector representations), **prompt catalogs** (regulated as code + data), **feedback logs** (agent decision outcomes), and **model lineage records** (EU AI Act traceability). MLflow's Prompt Registry exemplifies this shift in tooling, as identified in the TOGAF BDAT stress-test research (Medium, Sept 2025).

**5. Business Architecture: Dynamic Capabilities Replace Static Models** — Traditional Business Architecture documents stable capabilities. AI-DLC and agentic AI create capabilities that "learn and adapt in motion." Examples: Walmart and Carrefour already use AI to shift pricing and promotions dynamically — what was a quarterly campaign is now an hourly decision. GlobalCorp's Business Capability Map (BCM-APEX-001) must be updated to flag "adaptive capabilities" and their governance implications separately from static capabilities.

### AI-DLC Adoption Roadmap

GlobalCorp will adopt AI-DLC in a phased approach aligned to APEX delivery horizons, to avoid disrupting in-flight architecture governance while capturing productivity gains:

| Horizon / Period | AI-DLC Adoption Scope | EA Impact | Governance Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H0: Observe (Q1 2025) | AI-DLC training for architecture team; pilot on 2 work packages | Minimal; existing ADM retained | CTO sign-off on pilot |
| H1: Adopt for Build (Q2–Q3 2025) | AI-DLC Construction phase for Pioneer Domain 1 & 2 delivery | Phase C/D artefacts AI-assisted; peer review mandatory | ARB approves AI-assisted artefacts |
| H2: Extend to Inception (Q4 2025) | Mob Elaboration for Pioneer 3–5 requirements and architecture vision | Phase A/B artefacts AI-generated; ARB review process updated | Steering Committee endorses |
| H3: Full AI-DLC (Q1–Q2 2026) | End-to-end AI-DLC across all APEX workstreams; real-time governance | Full operating model transformation; LeanIX AI integration | Architecture Board annual review |

## Preliminary Phase — Foundation

PRELIMINARY Architecture capability, principles, tailored ADM, repository The Preliminary Phase establishes GlobalCorp's architecture capability for APEX. Governance structures are put in place, the ADM is tailored for regulatory context, and architecture principles that govern every subsequent decision are ratified.

### Architecture Principles — APD-001

#### Business Principles

| ID | Principle | Statement | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BP-01 | AI as Business Capability | Every APEX agent traces to a measurable business outcome in the Corporate Strategy Map; productivity gains are tracked quarterly against actuals | Business Value Case required before APEX onboarding; quarterly actuals vs. targets reported to steering committee |
| BP-02 | Human-in-the-Loo p — Inviolable | All agents acting on sensitive data or high-stakes decisions have a human escalation path that is pipeline-enforced and cannot be bypassed for velocity | HITL gates configured in the agent gateway; any removal requires Group CTO written exception logged in compliance register |
| BP-03 | Platform Thinking with Sprawl Controls | No division procures standalone AI tools if APEX can meet the need within 90 days; equally, no agent is created without registry entry and monthly health score | ARB approval for procurement; agent registry is the source of truth; unregistered agents blocked at gateway |
| BP-04 | Data Maturity Before AI Velocity | AI-DLC Construction cannot begin for any domain until the

**Data Maturity Gate** (5 checks) is passed | Data maturity assessment is the first deliverable of every Pioneer Domain onboarding; it is a programme gate not a guideline |

#### Data Principles

| ID | Principle | Statement | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DP-01 | Data Sovereignty | Personal and sensitive data processed by APEX agents must remain within the contractually agreed jurisdiction | AI inference endpoints provisioned per jurisdiction; network policy blocks cross-border calls for C4-class data at the kernel level |
| DP-02 | Data as Shared Asset | All data consumed by agents is catalogued in the Data Mesh with documented lineage before an agent goes to production | No agent deployed without data catalog entry covering every data source it touches; Data Architect sign-off required |
| DP-03 | Explainability Before Deployment | Every model has a documented explainability method — including the retrieval stage of RAG, not just the generation stage | RAG retrieval explanation is part of the DEA; explainability report is a mandatory CI/CD gate artefact |
| DP-04 | AI Assets as Governed Data | Prompt templates, embeddings, feedback logs, and model lineage records are first-class governed data assets with the same rigor as operational data | Embedding Compatibility Contract applies; ML model registry tracks all lineage; DPO sign-off for sensitive-adjacent prompts |
| DP-05 | Embedding Compatibility Enforced | Any embedding model upgrade triggers automatic full re-indexing of all dependent knowledge bases; RAGAS regression gate blocks production activation | CI/CD pipeline blocks embedding upgrade without RAGAS pass; 90-day rollback window maintained |

#### Technology Principles

| ID | Principle | Statement | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TP-01 | Cloud-Native Open Standards | Platform uses CNCF-hosted and open-standard components; proprietary cloud SDKs used only where equivalent OSS is not production-ready | All components containerised; OpenAPI for agent interfaces; OpenTelemetry for observability; no cloud SDK in core business logic |
| TP-02 | Security by Design | Security architecture is approved by the CISO delegate before any IaC is written for a given Pioneer Domain | Security is a Phase D entry gate; it is not a Phase G concern; zero-trust NetworkPolicy defined before build begins |
| TP-03 | Observability as First-Class | Every agent emits OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics, and structured logs from the first commit; no agent reaches UAT without a Grafana dashboard | Dashboard-as-code is generated in bolt 1; observability is part of the Definition of Done for every agent |
| TP-04 | Cost Transparency with Hard Throttle | Each agent has a tagged cost centre; budget enforced with a hard throttle at 110% of monthly budget that cannot be self-overridden by the agent | Budget throttle is enforced at the agent gateway level, not just an alert; SRE Lead is the only person who can override with a logged justification |
| TP-05 | Layered Verification | AI-generated IaC passes five verification layers (L1 static analysis, L2 AI explanation artefact, L3 property tests, L4 canary deploy, L5 drift detection) before merge; no single-person hero review is sufficient at enterprise scale | CI/CD enforces L1–L4 automatically; L2 AI explanation artefact retained 12 months per IaC commit |
| TP-06 | Decision Explanation Artefact by Default | Every High-Risk AI agent (EU AI Act Art.6) produces a Decision Explanation Artefact (DEA) for every regulated decision — assembled from all log sources and stored immutably for 7 years | DEA generation service is a mandatory platform component; deployed with Pioneer 1 and applied to all subsequent Pioneers |

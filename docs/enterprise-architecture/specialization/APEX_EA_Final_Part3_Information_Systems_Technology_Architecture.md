*Continues from [Part 2: AI-DLC Methodology & Foundation Architecture](./APEX_EA_Final_Part2_AI_DLC_Methodology_Foundation_Architecture.md).*

## Information Systems Architecture (Phase C)

PHASE C Data, AI-native entities, application components, and API catalogue

### Data Classification Framework

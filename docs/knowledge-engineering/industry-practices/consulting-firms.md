# Consulting Firm AI Knowledge Platforms

The major consultancies are unusually valuable case studies: their product *is* knowledge, they deployed firm-wide generative AI earlier than most enterprises, and — uniquely — they published their lessons. Collectively the Big Four and top strategy houses have invested **$10B+ in AI initiatives since 2023**. Research current as of July 2026.

## McKinsey — Lilli

**Lilli** is the most thoroughly documented internal knowledge platform in the industry.

### What it is

A firm-wide assistant over McKinsey's proprietary corpus: **40+ curated knowledge sources, 100,000+ documents**, interview transcripts, and sector playbooks. A query is embedded, matched against the internal index, and the **five to seven most relevant artifacts** are surfaced with **inline citations**, plus a summary. Lilli then cross-references McKinsey's **expert graph** (spanning 70 countries) to recommend the partners or specialists best placed for follow-up. Two modes: internal knowledge search, and external sources.

McKinsey is explicit that Lilli is *not* "a RAG instance" but an orchestration stack combining many technologies.

### Adoption and impact

Rolled out firm-wide in July 2023; by 2025, **72% of the firm was active** on the platform, with reported time savings of **up to 30%** in searching and synthesizing knowledge.

### Published lessons

1. **Data quality is the product.** "Generative AI tools are only as good as the data" — a clear data strategy with tagging, labeling, and curation is prerequisite, not optional.
2. **Parse your real formats.** Most of McKinsey's knowledge lives in PowerPoint; off-the-shelf parsers extracted only ~15% of a deck. They built their own tooling to reach 85%+ extraction of any document type. Unglamorous ingestion engineering dominated the effort.
3. **Balance building vs learning.** The team deliberately slowed feature-building to wait for user feedback — the product improved more from usage learning than from code.
4. **Diverse expertise from the start.** The MVP team was lean and technical; the scaled team added legal, adoption/change-management, communications, and subject-matter specialists, because a knowledge platform touches all of them.

### Evaluation practice

McKinsey used **blind scoring**: outputs from consultants with and without Lilli were rated on a predefined **five-point scale for accuracy, content richness, and distinctiveness** — a human-judged golden-set evaluation predating today's automated LLM-as-judge norms.

## BCG — GENE and Deckster

- **GENE** is BCG's proprietary internal chatbot, built on GPT-4o under its OpenAI partnership and fed with BCG's internal knowledge.
- **Deckster** targets the firm's highest-volume artifact: PowerPoint slide preparation, trained on BCG's slide corpus and templates.

BCG's split — a general knowledge assistant plus a workflow-specific tool — reflects a broader consulting pattern: general chat drives adoption, but workflow-embedded tools (slides, proposals) drive measurable time savings.

## Deloitte — PairD

Deloitte launched **PairD** in late 2023 as its internal AI helper for drafting emails, writing code, creating presentations, and producing meeting agendas — a productivity-first assistant rolled out across a workforce of hundreds of thousands, later complemented by domain-specific assistants across audit and advisory.

## EY — EY.ai / EYQ

EY committed **$1.4B** to its EY.ai platform (2023) and deployed **EYQ to 300,000+ professionals** — secure enterprise chat, domain assistants, **governed prompt tooling**, and sandboxed generative-AI experimentation across all service lines. EY has since published a case study on building an **enterprise-scale agentic AI operating system**, moving from chat toward governed agent orchestration.

## KPMG — KymChat and the agent pivot

KPMG built **KymChat** as its internal assistant, then standardized on the Microsoft AI stack (Azure AI Foundry) to let **employees build their own AI agents** across audit, tax, and advisory — betting on enterprise-wide agent development under a common governance platform rather than a single central assistant.

## Accenture — AI Refinery, SynOps, and workforce mandate

Accenture's distinctive move is workforce-scale enablement backed by policy: it trained **550,000 of ~780,000 employees** in generative AI (tools including **AI Refinery** and **SynOps**), and from 2025 **promotion applications must explain how the employee uses AI** in their job — governance through incentive design, not just tooling.

## Cross-firm patterns

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Curated corpus over "index everything"** | Lilli's 40+ *curated* sources; quality gates on what enters the knowledge base |
| **Citations + expert routing** | Lilli surfaces sources inline and routes to human experts — grounding plus human oversight in one flow |
| **Ingestion is the hard part** | McKinsey's PowerPoint parsing (15% → 85%) |
| **Human-judged evaluation baselines** | McKinsey's blind 5-point scoring before automated evals existed |
| **Governed experimentation** | EYQ's governed prompt tooling and safe sandboxes |
| **From chat to governed agents** | EY agentic AI OS, KPMG employee-built agents on Azure AI Foundry |
| **Adoption as a managed program** | Lilli's 72% active use; Accenture tying AI use to promotion |

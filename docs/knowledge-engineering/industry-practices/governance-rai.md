# Governance & Responsible AI for Knowledge Systems

How enterprises govern the data that feeds AI knowledge systems, enforce Responsible AI at runtime, and map it all to the three frameworks that matter: NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Research current as of July 2026.

## The core finding: governance sits upstream of retrieval

The consistent lesson from enterprise deployments is that **retrieval platforms serve whatever they're given**. No RAG stack decides on its own which data is authoritative, who may access it, or whether it's still accurate. That requires a separate **governance / context layer upstream of the retrieval stack**, answering three questions before a single chunk is embedded:

1. **Authority** — is this source the system of record, or a stale copy / draft / opinion?
2. **Access** — who is entitled to see it, and can that entitlement be enforced per chunk at query time?
3. **Accuracy & freshness** — is it current, and is its lineage known?

Modern pipelines therefore layer governance controls, access policies, and context graphs *ahead* of retrieval so that only authorized, high-quality information ever reaches the model.

## The governance layer in practice

### Catalogs, lineage, and unified permission models

- **Databricks Unity Catalog** centralizes access control, audit, lineage, and discovery across tables, files, ML models, and AI assets. A RAG pipeline that reads PDFs, embeds them, and writes vectors back operates **under one consistent permission model** end to end.
- **Unity AI Gateway** (announced at Data + AI Summit 2026) extends this from *access* to *action*: agents, external models, MCP services, and skills are registered, discovered, secured, and audited with the same governance framework as data — runtime governance for the agentic era.
- **Microsoft Purview**, **DataHub**, and **Snowflake Horizon** play equivalent roles in their stacks; tools like Atlan federate context across several of them into one context layer.

### Permissions-aware retrieval

The Microsoft 365 Copilot pattern is the reference: the semantic index stores per-document permissions, retrieval is filtered **dynamically at query time** through the same RBAC that governs the source applications, and the model never sees content the querying user couldn't open. In 2026 production systems this extends to **chunk-level access control**.

### Provenance and lineage

End-to-end lineage (source → transformation → chunk → embedding → answer citation) serves two masters at once: debugging retrieval quality, and producing the **source traceability** the EU AI Act expects from retrieval-based systems.

## Responsible AI: enforced at runtime, not in policy documents

The 2026 shift is that RAI moved from principles decks to **infrastructure-level runtime enforcement**:

| Mechanism | Example | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Safeguard models | Meta **Llama Guard** (Purple Llama) | Classifies prompts *and* responses into safety risk categories as an I/O filter |
| Managed guardrails | **Amazon Bedrock Guardrails** | Six policies: content moderation, prompt-attack detection, topic controls, PII redaction, hallucination/grounding checks, and Automated Reasoning checks with verifiable explanations; applies across any model, including third-party |
| Grounding verification | Vertex AI grounding, dual-LLM verify | Checks generations against retrieved/authoritative sources before serving |
| Policy-enforcing search | Glean Protect-class tooling | AI policy enforcement on agent responses, PII/over-sharing detection over the knowledge graph |

A 2026 caution: tests showed built-in restrictions on downloadable open-weight models can be stripped in minutes — so enterprises are moving to **continuous auditing of deployed behavior** rather than trusting model-provider assurances.

## The standards stack

The three frameworks are complementary, not competing. The common formulation: **NIST provides the risk-management methodology, ISO 42001 the auditable management system, and the EU AI Act the legal requirements.**

### NIST AI RMF (+ Generative AI Profile)

- Voluntary US framework (2023) organized around **Govern, Map, Measure, Manage**; widely referenced by regulators as a baseline.
- **NIST-AI-600-1** (July 2024), the Generative AI Profile, identifies **12 GenAI-specific risk categories** and concrete actions — the standard vocabulary for GenAI risk registers.

### ISO/IEC 42001

- First certifiable **AI management system (AIMS)** standard (2023). Follows the Annex SL structure shared with ISO 27001/9001, so it slots into existing compliance programs.
- **ISO/IEC 42006:2025** standardizes auditor competence, making certifications comparable.
- For knowledge systems: eval datasets and pipelines should carry governance annotations — provenance, reviewer identity, instructions, consent flags, risk tags — to support 42001/NIST traceability.

### EU AI Act — the timeline that matters for knowledge systems

| Date | Obligation |
|---|---|
| Aug 2, 2025 | GPAI model provider obligations apply (technical documentation, training-data summary, risk policies, systemic-risk notification to the AI Office) |
| **Aug 2, 2026** | Commission **enforcement** of GPAI obligations begins; Act broadly applicable |
| **Jun 8, 2026** | Final technical guidelines for high-risk systems published — **explicitly covering retrieval-based generative architectures** (systems fetching context from knowledge bases/vector stores must meet the same transparency, accountability, and fairness standards as other regulated decision tools) |
| Aug 2, 2027 | Pre-Aug-2025 GPAI models must comply |
| Dec 2, 2027 / Aug 2, 2028 | High-risk obligations (Annex III / Annex II) — pushed from 2026/2027 by the May 2026 Digital Omnibus provisional agreement |

A well-designed RAG system directly supports several Act requirements: **source traceability** (citations), **answer transparency**, **human oversight** (expert routing, review flows), and **data governance**.

## A practical governance checklist

1. Curate an **authoritative-source registry** before indexing anything (McKinsey's 40+ curated sources, Airbnb's trust signals).
2. Mirror **source-system ACLs into the index**; enforce at query time, per chunk.
3. Capture **lineage from source to citation**; retain audit logs of what was retrieved for every answer.
4. Put **runtime guardrails** (I/O classification, PII redaction, grounding checks) in the serving path, model-agnostically.
5. Annotate eval and training datasets for **ISO 42001 / NIST traceability**.
6. Map your system against the **EU AI Act risk tiers** now; if it informs consequential decisions, assume high-risk obligations by Dec 2027.
7. **Continuously audit deployed behavior** — don't rely on model-provider guarantees.

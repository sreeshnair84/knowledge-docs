# Grounding Architectures

How production systems in 2026 make LLM answers verifiably grounded in enterprise knowledge: hybrid retrieval, knowledge-graph grounding, permissions-aware serving, and verification patterns. Research current as of July 2026.

## What "grounding" means operationally

Grounding is the guarantee that every claim in a generated answer is traceable to retrieved, authorized, current source content — and that the system **refuses** rather than improvises when the sources don't support an answer. It decomposes into four sub-problems: retrieve the *right* content, restrict it to *authorized* content, force the generator to *stay within* it, and *verify* that it did.

## The 2026 production baseline: hybrid, multi-stage retrieval

Single-method vector search is no longer the production standard. The default architecture is:

```
query
  │  query rewriting / decomposition
  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HYBRID RETRIEVAL (parallel)                 │
│  BM25/keyword  ·  dense vector  ·  graph /  │
│  structured layer (entities, relationships) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  │  chunk-level ACL filtering (query-time)
  ▼
cross-encoder reranking
  ▼
generation with mandatory citations
  ▼
groundedness verification (judge / dual-LLM)
```

- **Hybrid beats semantic-only** measurably: ~66.4% MRR vs 56.7% in published comparisons — a 9+ point retrieval gain that flows directly into answer quality.
- **Reranking is standard**: a cross-encoder pass over the merged candidate set, with rigorous reranking plus strict governance described as the production norm for 2026.
- **Chunk-level access control** is applied *inside* the retrieval stage (see [Governance & RAI](governance-rai.md)), not as post-filtering.

## Knowledge-graph grounding (GraphRAG)

For questions involving entities and relationships — org structures, product hierarchies, multi-hop "who/what connects to what" — text-chunk retrieval alone underperforms badly. The headline evidence: LLMs answering complex enterprise questions reached **16.7% accuracy without knowledge-graph grounding vs 54.2% with it** (+37.5 points).

Practitioner guidance for 2026:

- Use GraphRAG where the *query pattern* is relational (multi-hop, aggregation over entities); plain hybrid RAG remains cheaper and sufficient for lookup/summarization queries.
- The graph earns its complexity as a **shared, governed entity layer** — the same graph powers retrieval, disambiguation, and expert routing (compare LinkedIn's Economic Graph and McKinsey Lilli's expert graph).

## Verification and citation patterns

Production systems increasingly treat generation as untrusted until verified:

| Pattern | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Mandatory citations** | Generator must attach source references per claim; uncited claims are stripped or the answer is rejected |
| **Dual-LLM verification** | One model generates, a second independently checks each claim against the retrieved context |
| **Refusal outside the corpus** | Questions not answerable from the curated knowledge base get an explicit refusal, not a best guess |
| **Faithfulness gates** | Groundedness scores (e.g., RAGAS faithfulness) as deployment gates — the strictest production systems gate at ≥0.97 |
| **Grounding-check guardrails** | Managed services (e.g., Bedrock Guardrails' hallucination detection, Vertex grounding) validate answers against sources in the serving path |

McKinsey's Lilli illustrates the human-facing version: 5–7 sources surfaced with inline citations plus routing to named experts — grounding and human oversight in one interaction.

## Adaptive and agentic retrieval

Two refinements define the leading edge in 2026:

- **Adaptive RAG** — a lightweight classifier routes each query by complexity: simple lookups go to cheap single-pass retrieval, complex questions to multi-stage or graph pipelines. Best cost/quality trade-off at scale.
- **Agentic RAG** — replaces single-pass retrieve-then-generate with an agent that retrieves, assesses sufficiency, reformulates, and retrieves again before answering. This is converging with the broader agent-governance stack (agents as governed, audited actors — see Unity AI Gateway in [Governance & RAI](governance-rai.md)). The 2027–2028 trajectory extends this to multimodal and real-time RAG.

## Design rules of thumb

1. **Curate before you index** — grounding on a stale or unauthoritative corpus is confidently wrong at scale.
2. **Hybrid + rerank is the floor**, not the ceiling; add a graph layer only when query patterns are relational.
3. **Make citations load-bearing**: if an answer can't cite, it shouldn't ship.
4. **Refusal is a feature** — measure and reward it on out-of-corpus questions.
5. **Verify in the serving path**, then monitor the same faithfulness signal in production (see [Evaluation & Quality Gates](evaluation.md)).

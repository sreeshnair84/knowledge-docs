SCENARIOS 5 & 6

🎯 Core Techniques — The Big 3

1\. JSON Schema

Define exact structure: field names, types, required/optional fields, constraints, nesting. Model must match this exactly. Enables validation before downstream use.

2\. Few-Shot Examples

Show the model EXACTLY what good output looks like. Include edge cases in examples. More examples = more consistent. Input→Output pairs teach format implicitly.

3\. Extraction Patterns

Prompt constructs that direct the model to locate and pull specific fields from unstructured text. Handles varied document formats, layouts, and phrasing.

✓ These 3 techniques are explicitly called out in Task Statement 4.x — know all three

Supporting Technique

Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Have model reason through problem before producing structured output. Improves accuracy on complex extractions. Costs more tokens.

📋 JSON Schema — Production Pattern

// SYSTEM PROMPT: Define the exact schema "Extract invoice data as JSON matching this schema exactly: { 'invoice_id': string (format: 'INV-XXXXX'), 'vendor_name': string, 'date': string (ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD), 'line_items': [ { 'description': string, 'quantity': number, 'unit_price': number, 'total': number } ], 'subtotal': number, 'tax_rate': number (0-1, e.g. 0.08 for 8%), 'total_due': number, 'due_date': string (ISO 8601) | null } Return ONLY the JSON object. No explanation. If a field is missing, use null."

⚠ Under-specified schemas → inconsistent field names, structures, missing fields across calls

✓ Always validate extracted JSON against schema before passing to downstream systems

📚 Few-Shot Examples Design

Structure of Good Few-Shot Prompts

/* Example 1: Normal case */ Input: "Invoice #12345 from Acme Corp dated January 15, 2024 for $1,250.00" Output: { "invoice_id": "INV-12345", "vendor_name": "Acme Corp", "date": "2024-01-15", "total": 1250.00 } /* Example 2: EDGE CASE — missing due date */ Input: "Bill from TechCo, Feb 2024, $500" Output: { "invoice_id": null, "vendor_name": "TechCo", "date": "2024-02-01", "due_date": null } /* Example 3: EDGE CASE — ambiguous format */

Few-Shot Principles

  * Include edge cases — not just happy path
  * Show null handling — missing/ambiguous fields
  * Match real data — use realistic examples
  * More = consistent — 3-5 examples recommended
  * Cover format variations in input examples

🔍 Extraction Pattern Design

What Extraction Patterns Solve

Reliably pulling specific data fields from varied, unstructured source documents that may differ in layout, format, and phrasing

Pattern Structure

"From the following text, extract: 1\. DATE: The date mentioned (convert to YYYY-MM-DD) 2\. AMOUNT: Dollar amount (as number, no $ symbol) 3\. VENDOR: Company or person name 4\. PURPOSE: Reason for payment (1-3 words) If information is not present, use null. Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated. Do not infer or assume missing values. Text: {document_text}"

✓ Numbered extraction list = systematic coverage

✓ "Do not infer" = reduces hallucination risk

⚠ Without patterns, model may paraphrase instead of extract exact values

⚙️ Scenario 5: CI/CD Feedback Prompts

Actionable Feedback Schema

// Each feedback item MUST have these fields: { "file": "src/api/handler.js", "line": 42, "severity": "error" | "warning" | "suggestion", "issue": "Unhandled promise rejection", "suggestion": "Add .catch() or use try/catch with await" } 

Minimize False Positives By

  * Define exact criteria for each severity level
  * Specify scope — what NOT to flag
  * Provide examples of true positive vs false positive
  * Context-aware — don't flag test code like production
  * Avoid style opinions unless eslint rules are defined

Primary Domains

🔗 Context Management & Reliability (Domain 5)

3 Core Challenges

Long docsChunking, RAG, or summarize earlier sections to fit in window

Multi-turnRetain relevant context, prune resolved subtopics proactively

Agent handoffsPreserve: decisions, gathered data, task state, user prefs, constraints

Reliability Patterns

Human-in-loopPause for approval at high-stakes decisions — not just errors

Self-evaluationAgent checks own FORMAT/COMPLETENESS — NOT factual accuracy

Clear escalationDeterministic criteria defined upfront, not left to model judgment

Structured handoffsCustomer ID + root cause + recommended action for human agents

Escalation Design

// Define escalation criteria EXPLICITLY const shouldEscalate = (ctx) => { // Confidence threshold if (ctx.confidence < 0.7) return true; // Issue category rules if (FRAUD_CASES.includes(ctx.category)) return true; // Policy boundary if (ctx.refundAmount > 500) return true; return false; }; 

✓ Deterministic criteria = reliable decisions at scale

📊 Scenario 6: Structured Data Extraction

System goalExtract from unstructured docs, validate via JSON schema, integrate downstream

Primary domainsPrompt Engineering & Structured Output + Context Management & Reliability

System Requirements

  * Handle unstructured docs
  * JSON schema validation
  * High accuracy maintained
  * Graceful edge case handling
  * Downstream system integration

Design Checklist

  * ✓ Define schema upfront
  * ✓ 3-5 few-shot examples with edge cases
  * ✓ Explicit null handling instruction
  * ✓ "Extract only, don't infer"
  * ✓ Validate output before use
  * ✓ Handle malformed input gracefully

Prompt Engineering Anti-Patterns

Vague output instructions → inconsistent format, missing fields, type mismatches

No edge cases in examples → model improvises inconsistently on unusual inputs

Schema without validation → downstream errors discovered late

Allowing inference → model "fills in" values it shouldn't, creating hallucinations

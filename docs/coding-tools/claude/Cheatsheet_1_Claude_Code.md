BUILT-IN TOOLS

CLAUDE.md CONFIG

🔧 Built-in Tools — Selection Guide

Grep

Search **FILE CONTENTS** for patterns

→ Finding function callers, error messages, import statements, string patterns inside files

Glob

Match **FILE PATHS/NAMES** by pattern

→ **/*.test.tsx finds all TS test files recursively. Navigate structure, not content

Read

**Full file read** — entire file into context

→ Always Read before Write to preserve unmodified content

Write

**Full file write** — overwrites completely

→ Use after Read when Edit fails on non-unique matches

Edit

**Targeted modification** via unique text matching

→ Specify exact text to find (must be unique) → replace. Surgical, minimal diff

Bash

**Execute shell commands** in the environment

→ Run tests, git ops, npm install, lint checks, build commands

⚠ Edit FAILS when text appears more than once → fallback: Read + Write

📄 CLAUDE.md — Configuration Reference

What to include

Project contextRepository structure, tech stack, architecture overview, key directories

Coding conventionsStyle guide, naming patterns, design patterns to follow/avoid

Test commandsHow to run unit/integration tests so Claude can self-validate changes

Build/lint commandsnpm run build, eslint, prettier — Claude runs these after changes

Custom slash cmds/review, /deploy, /test — shortcuts to trigger specific behaviors

Agent SkillsReusable team-specific capabilities that persist across sessions

MCP serversWhich servers to connect, what tools they expose, when to use them

Do NOT includeAPI keys, secrets, credentials — use environment variables

✓ CLAUDE.md persists knowledge across sessions — team shares conventions without re-explaining

Agent Skills vs Slash Commands

Agent Skills

  * Reusable capabilities
  * Complex multi-step behaviors
  * Team knowledge (deploy process)
  * Defined in CLAUDE.md

Slash Commands

  * Quick shortcuts
  * Trigger specific skill/behavior
  * /review, /test, /explain
  * Saves repetitive typing

📋 Plan Mode vs Direct Execution

📋 PLAN MODE | ⚡ DIRECT MODE  
---|---  
Proposes actions first | Executes immediately  
Human reviews before run | No review step  
Higher safety, slower | Fast iteration  
High-risk operations | Low-risk dev tasks  
Major refactoring | Bug fixes, additions  
Production changes | Local development  
File deletions | Read operations  
  
✓ Plan mode = human oversight at critical decision points

🔀 Session Management

fork_sessionCreates parallel branches from current state — compare 2 refactoring approaches simultaneously

Session resumeContinues from prior context — use when prior state is still valid/relevant

Fresh + summariesStart new session, inject summarized context — use when tool results are stale

Targeted re-analysisInform resumed session about specific file changes — avoids full re-exploration

When to Resume vs Fresh Start

Resume: prior context mostly valid, files unchanged, continuing same task

Fresh: file system changed, new requirements, stale tool results, new codebase

🔄 CI/CD Integration (Scenario 5)

System Capabilities

  * Automated code review on every PR
  * Test case generation for new code
  * PR feedback with structured output
  * Runs in pipeline — no human trigger

Prompt Design Goals

Actionable feedbackFile + line + issue + severity + suggested fix

Minimize false positivesClear criteria, scope boundaries, what NOT to flag

Severity levelserror / warning / suggestion — not all equal weight

Primary Domains Tested

Claude Code Config Prompt Engineering

🌳 Tool Selection Decision Tree

Goal: Find something

  * Function all callers? → Grep (content)
  * All .tsx files? → Glob (paths)
  * Error message in logs? → Grep (content)
  * Config file location? → Glob (paths)
  * Import pattern? → Grep (content)

Goal: Modify a file

  * Change one unique thing? → Edit
  * Edit fails (non-unique)? → Read+Write
  * Create new file? → Write directly
  * Large restructure? → Read+Write

Glob Pattern Examples

## All TypeScript test files **/*.test.tsx **/*.spec.ts # All files in src/ src/**/* # Config files **/*.config.js **/.env* # Nested components src/components/**/*.tsx

Grep Examples

## Find all callers of fn grep -r "myFunction(" . # Find imports grep -r "from 'lodash'" . # Error messages grep -r "Cannot read" logs/

⚠️ Anti-Patterns & Common Mistakes

Using Edit on non-unique text → always fails silently or wrong match

Writing files without Reading first → overwrites unintended content

Using Glob to search file content → only matches paths/filenames

Using Grep to find files by name → use Glob for paths

Storing secrets in CLAUDE.md → use environment variables

Running destructive Bash without plan mode → data loss risk

Not informing resumed session of file changes → stale re-analysis

EXAM TRAPS

  * Grep vs Glob: Grep=contents, Glob=paths — exam loves this distinction
  * Edit fallback: non-unique match → Read+Write (not just retry Edit)
  * Plan mode: requires human review BEFORE execution, not just logging
  * fork_session: parallel exploration branches — not git fork

📦 Scenario 2: Code Generation

ContextTeam uses Claude Code for gen, refactoring, debugging, docs

Key taskIntegrate into dev workflow with CLAUDE.md + custom commands + plan mode

Primary domainsClaude Code Config, Context Management

Setup Checklist

  * CLAUDE.md with project structure
  * Custom slash commands for common tasks
  * Test command so Claude self-validates
  * Define Agent Skills for team workflows
  * MCP servers for Jira/GitHub integration
  * Plan mode for risky operations

🎯 Key Exam Facts — Domain 3

Domain weight20% of exam (tied with Domain 4)

Primary scenariosScenario 2 (Code Gen), Scenario 4 (Dev Productivity), Scenario 5 (CI/CD)

CLAUDE.md purposeProject context, conventions, commands — persists across sessions

Plan mode triggerHigh-risk, production changes, major refactoring, deletions

fork_sessionParallel exploration branches, NOT git fork

Edit requirementText must appear EXACTLY ONCE — otherwise fails

Grep = contentSearches inside files for patterns

Glob = pathsMatches file/directory names and patterns

🚀 Scenario 4: Developer Productivity

ContextIntegrating Claude into day-to-day dev workflow for productivity

Primary domainsTool Design & MCP, Claude Code Config, Agentic Architecture

Productivity Patterns

  * MCP connects Claude to Jira, GitHub, Slack
  * Slash commands for code review workflow
  * Agent Skills for team-specific processes
  * fork_session for A/B refactoring
  * Plan mode before production deployments
  * Resumed sessions preserve work context

✓ Dev productivity = tool integrations + configured conventions + smart session management

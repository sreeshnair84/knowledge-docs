🖥️ Cowork Deep Dive

How Cowork Works

ArchitectureBuilt on same agent foundation as Claude Code — runs in isolated VM (Apple Virtualization / VMware)

File accessYou grant access to specific folder — Claude reads/writes/creates inside it only

ExecutionAnalyze → Plan → Execute in VM → Coordinate sub-agents → Deliver to filesystem

Parallel workQueue tasks — Claude works through them in parallel, you don't wait

Deletion protectionClaude always asks explicit permission before permanently deleting files

Scheduled tasksSet recurring tasks — Claude completes automatically on schedule

Cowork Tasks Examples

  * Re-organize downloads folder by sorting & renaming
  * Create expense spreadsheet from receipt screenshots
  * Draft report from scattered notes in folder
  * Research + synthesize into formatted document
  * Monitor plant growth (from photo folders)
  * Build slide deck from existing data files

Connectors & Plugins

Web connectorsBrowser-based APIs — Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, DocuSign, FactSet

Desktop ext.Deep system access — n8n, AWS, Honeycomb, Fellow.ai, Apollo, Clay

PluginsPackaged skills + agents + hooks + MCP. Install via /plugins. Anthropic-reviewed.

Enterprise pluginsHR, finance, engineering, ops, investment banking, equity research, wealth mgmt

Global instructionsSet preferred tone/format/role once — applies to every Cowork session

Folder instructionsPer-folder context that activates when working in that folder

Security Considerations

Cowork can take destructive actions (delete files) if instructed — give very clear guidance

Prompt injection: malicious content in files could manipulate Claude's actions

Do NOT use for regulated workloads — activity not in Audit Logs or Compliance API

Runs in sandboxed VM — Claude cannot access files outside what you explicitly grant

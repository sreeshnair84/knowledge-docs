# AI Fluency Cheat Sheet

## 🧠 AI FLUENCY — Core Concepts

ALL DOMAINS

FOUNDATIONAL

🏗️ LLM Architecture Fundamentals

Transformer

Architecture underlying all modern LLMs. Self-attention allows parallel processing and long-range dependencies.

Token

Unit of text (≈¾ of a word). Models think in tokens, not words. "Claude" = 1 token. "Anthropic" = 2-3 tokens.

Context window

Maximum tokens the model can "see" at once (input + output). Everything outside is invisible to the model.

Inference

Running the model to generate output. Each forward pass predicts the next token probabilistically.

Temperature

Controls randomness. 0 = deterministic (always most likely). 1 = more creative. Production: usually 0-0.3 for consistency.

Hallucination

Model generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information. Common with: rare facts, specific numbers, citations.

System prompt

Instructions sent before user message. Sets context, persona, constraints. High influence on behavior.

Few-shot

Including examples in the prompt to guide model behavior. More examples = more consistent output format.

📐 Context Window Management

Context = What the model can "see"

Input tokensSystem prompt + conversation history + tool results + user message

Output tokensGenerated response + tool call parameters (counted separately)

Window limitTotal input + output must fit. Exceeding truncates or errors.

Lost = invisibleContent outside window is completely inaccessible — model cannot reason about it

Strategies for Long Content

ChunkingBreak document into segments. Process each chunk. Re-assemble results.

SummarizationCompress earlier conversation/docs into summaries to free space

RAGRetrieval-augmented generation — retrieve only relevant chunks via search

Selective retentionKeep relevant turns, prune resolved subtopics from history

3 Context Challenges (Exam Key)

📄 Long documents

💬 Multi-turn conversations

🤝 Multi-agent handoffs

✓ Context poisoning: stale/incorrect info from earlier turns contaminating current reasoning → prune proactively

✅ Model Capabilities

Strong At

  * Reasoning — multi-step logic, inference
  * Code — generation, review, debugging, refactoring
  * Summarization — compressing long content
  * Structured extraction — pulling data from text
  * Translation — natural and programming languages
  * Following instructions — schemas, formats, rules
  * Role-following — maintaining context across turns
  * Tool use — calling tools based on descriptions

Key Strengths for Production

  * Consistent with explicit schemas
  * Good at self-evaluation of format
  * Effective at decomposing complex tasks

⚠️ Model Limitations

Known Weaknesses

  * Hallucination — invents plausible but wrong facts
  * Knowledge cutoff — no real-time information
  * Math precision — unreliable for exact arithmetic
  * No persistent memory — each call is stateless
  * Context window cap — hard limit on input size
  * Inconsistency — same prompt can yield different outputs
  * Sycophancy — may agree with user even when wrong
  * Prompt sensitivity — small wording changes affect output

Production Mitigations

  * Schema validation to catch format errors
  * Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions
  * Self-evaluation patterns (format/completeness only)
  * Deterministic hooks for guaranteed compliance

🏭 Production Reliability Patterns

Structured outputJSON schemas + validation prevent format errors in downstream systems

Human-in-loopPause at high-stakes decision points for human approval

Self-evaluationAgent checks own output — use for FORMAT/COMPLETENESS, not fact accuracy

HooksDeterministic compliance — guaranteed, not probabilistic like prompts

Retry logicExponential backoff for tool failures; don't retry infinitely

Graceful degradationWhen tool fails, have fallback behavior defined

Context validationInject stale-data checks; inform resumed sessions of changes

⚠ Self-evaluation cannot verify FACTS — only format/structure completeness

💰 Token Economics & Practical Estimates

Token Approximations

1 token ≈¾ of an English word

1000 tokens ≈750 words / ~1.5 pages

Code token use≈ 1 token per ≈5 chars

Non-EnglishTypically more tokens per word

Context Window Impact

Long historyEats input budget → summarize or truncate

Tool resultsEach result added to history — can grow fast

System promptCounts against input — keep concise

Cost Optimization

  * Shorter system prompts
  * Summarize long histories
  * Return only needed fields from tools
  * Limit output with explicit instructions
  * Use appropriate model tier for task

Quality Optimization

  * More examples = better format adherence
  * Detailed schemas = fewer format errors
  * Explicit constraints = fewer edge-case failures
  * Step-by-step > one-shot for complex tasks

🧩 Mental Models for Production AI

The Right Way to Think About LLMs

LLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic — same input can produce different output. Design systems to handle this.

LLMs predict "what comes next" based on training — they don't "know" facts the way a database does.

LLMs follow patterns in descriptions — tool descriptions, schemas, and examples are code, not documentation.

Key Production Principles

  * Validate output against schemas — don't trust format blindly
  * Use hooks for compliance guarantees — not prompt instructions
  * Context window = working memory — manage it actively
  * Model has NO memory between API calls — you must pass history
  * Temperature 0 ≠ perfectly consistent — still probabilistic
  * Evaluate with real production examples — not toy cases

Exam Perspective

  * 6+ months prod experience expected
  * Understand capabilities AND limitations
  * Design for reliability in uncertainty

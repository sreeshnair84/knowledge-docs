TOOLS vs RESOURCES

SERVER DESIGN

⚖️ MCP Tools vs MCP Resources — Core Distinction

🔧 MCP TOOLS

⚡

Executable functions

Perform actions with potential side effects

💥

Has side effects

Creates records, sends emails, modifies data

📋

Examples

process_refund, send_email, create_ticket, lookup_order

🎯

When to use

Agent needs to DO something in external system

VS

📦 MCP RESOURCES

👁️

Read-only data

Expose data for reading — no side effects

📚

Static/queryable

Documentation, catalogs, configuration

📋

Examples

product_catalog, api_docs, feature_flags, user_schema

🎯

When to use

Agent needs to SEE available data without acting

✓ Content catalogs as resources: give agents visibility into available data WITHOUT requiring exploratory tool calls

📝 Tool Description Design — The #1 Factor

Tool descriptions are the PRIMARY mechanism LLMs use for tool selection — minimal descriptions = unreliable selection

What every tool description MUST include

PurposeWhat the tool does in plain language

Input formatsExpected data types, formats, constraints for each parameter

Example queriesSample inputs that should trigger this tool (not other similar tools)

Edge casesWhat happens with unusual inputs, what it cannot handle

BoundariesWhat this tool does NOT do — distinguishes from similar tools

The Misrouting Problem

analyze_content vs analyze_document with near-identical descriptions → Claude misroutes consistently or alternates unpredictably

Keyword-sensitive system prompts can create unintended tool associations — test prompts carefully

// ❌ BAD — ambiguous description { name: "analyze_content", description: "Analyzes content" } { name: "analyze_document", description: "Analyzes documents" } // ✅ GOOD — distinct, specific boundaries { name: "analyze_content", description: "Extracts key topics from SHORT text snippets (under 500 tokens). Do NOT use for PDFs or multi-page documents. Input: plain text string." } { name: "analyze_document", description: "Processes structured files (PDF, DOCX). Use for multi-page documents. Input: file path." } 

🏗️ MCP Server Design Decisions

Should I build a custom MCP server?

YES, if:

  * Proprietary internal system
  * Team-specific workflow
  * No community server exists
  * Custom authentication needed

NO, instead use community server for:

  * Jira (project management)
  * GitHub (version control)
  * Slack (messaging)
  * Standard API integrations

Server Architecture Principles

  * Expose resources for read-only data catalogs
  * Expose tools for executable actions with side effects
  * Group related tools in same server
  * Version your MCP server interfaces

🛠️ Task 2.5 — Built-in Tools Mastery

Grep**Content search** — inside files. Find function callers, error messages, import patterns

Glob**Path matching** — file names/extensions. Find `**/*.test.tsx` file tree navigation

ReadFull file read. Always Read before Write for existing files

WriteFull file overwrite. Fallback when Edit fails on non-unique text

EditTargeted modification via **unique** text matching only

BashShell execution — tests, git, build commands

Edit requires text to appear exactly ONCE — falls back to Read+Write for non-unique matches

🎯 Exam Focus: Domain 2

Domain weight18% — 2nd smallest domain

Key insightTool DESCRIPTIONS are primary tool selection mechanism

Tools vs ResourcesTools = actions + side effects; Resources = read-only data

Misrouting causeAmbiguous overlapping descriptions between similar tools

Community serversUse for Jira, GitHub, Slack — don't rebuild them

Content catalogsExpose as resources — no exploratory tool calls needed

💻 MCP Server Structure — Code Reference

// MCP Server Definition const server = new MCPServer({ name: "customer-support", version: "1.0.0" }); // TOOL — executable with side effects server.tool("process_refund", { description: "Processes a refund for an order. Use ONLY when customer confirms they want a refund and order is eligible. Input: orderId (string), amount (number, max 500), reason (string). Returns: confirmation_id or error.", parameters: { orderId: { type: "string", description: "Order ID from lookup_order" }, amount: { type: "number", maximum: 500 }, reason: { type: "string", enum: ["damaged", "not_received", "changed_mind"] } } }, async (params) => { // Execute refund — has side effect return await refundSystem.process(params); }); // RESOURCE — read-only data catalog server.resource("refund-policies", { description: "Read-only refund policy documentation and eligibility rules. No side effects." }, async () => { return await getPolicyDocs(); // read only }); 

✅ Tool Description — Best Practice Template

// Template: Every element serves a purpose { name: "lookup_order", description: ` PURPOSE: Retrieves complete order details including status, items, and tracking info. USE WHEN: Customer provides an order ID and needs order status, delivery info, or item details. DO NOT USE: For account-level queries (use get_customer) or refund processing (use process_refund). INPUT: orderId — string, format "ORD-XXXXXX" EXAMPLE: "ORD-123456", "ORD-789012" RETURNS: { status, items[], tracking, estimated_delivery, eligible_for_refund } ERRORS: Returns null if order not found. ` } 

✓ Include DO NOT USE section to prevent misrouting to similar tools

⚠ System prompt keywords can create unintended tool associations — audit your prompts

# CopilotKit MCP Apps vs Tools — EU Bank Design Decision

CopilotKit — Design Decision · EU Bank AI Copilot

## MCP Tools vs MCP Apps

Research-backed architecture recommendation for your Strands + AgentCore + CopilotKit platform, with EU banking security constraints applied.

Verdict: Hybrid strategy — Tools for data, Apps for interaction

01 — What's the difference

## Two Distinct Primitives

🔧

MCP Tools

Function-call pattern · Returns data · Host owns UI

What it does

Agent calls a function. Gets back JSON, text, or structured data. _Your app_ decides how to render it.

UI ownership

Host application (your React code) builds the UI for every tool result. Full control, more work.

AG-UI protocol

Streams tool progress events. UI components written in your codebase with `useCopilotAction`.

MCP spec

Original MCP spec — stable, widely supported, all frameworks.

Security surface

No iframes No external scripts CSP friendly

Best for

Account lookups, balance queries, risk scores, read-only data display, background orchestration steps.

🪟

MCP Apps

Interactive UI surface · Ships with MCP server · AG-UI sync

What it does

MCP server ships an interactive HTML/JS UI alongside the tool. CopilotKit renders it; AG-UI keeps it in sync with agent state.

UI ownership

Domain team (MCP server author) owns and ships their own UI. Rendered via `MCPAppsMiddleware` in sandboxed iframe.

AG-UI protocol

AG-UI is the sync channel: tool lifecycle, user interactions (clicks, form submits), agent state — all coordinated in real-time.

MCP spec

Proposed extension to MCP spec (Jan 2026, CopilotKit + community). Growing adoption. Newer — less stable

Security surface

Sandbox iframe required SRI hash enforcement CSP frame-src policy

Best for

Payment approval forms, KYC confirmation, multi-step wizards, data pickers, rich charts — UI the domain team owns end-to-end.

02 — Data flow comparison

## Under the Hood

### MCP Tools Flow

Agent (Strands)

↓ calls tool

MCP Server  
(AgentCore)

↓ returns JSON

CopilotKit Runtime  
(BFF)

↓ AG-UI event stream

React UI  
useCopilotAction render()

↓ renders natively

User sees result

Host app controls 100% of the rendering. No external bundles. Standard React component.

### MCP Apps Flow

Agent (Strands)

↓ calls tool → returns ui:// ref

MCP Apps Server  
(ships HTML + JS)

↓ MCPAppsMiddleware fetches bundle

CopilotKit Runtime  
(validates SRI hash)

↓ renders in sandboxed iframe

Iframe: Domain Team UI  
↕ AG-UI postMessage sync

↓ user interacts

Agent receives structured input

Domain team ships their own UI. AG-UI bridges iframe ↔ agent state in real-time.

03 — When to use which

## Decision Matrix by Banking Use Case

USE TOOLS

### Account Balance Lookup

Read-only query. Returns structured data. The copilot renders it inline as text or a simple card. No interaction needed from user.

USE APPS

#### Payment Initiation

Payment team owns the form UX: beneficiary picker, IBAN validator, amount entry, review screen. Ships as MCP App with full domain-team UI control.

USE TOOLS

#### Risk Score Query

Returns a score + signal breakdown. Agent narrates it. A simple React component in your codebase renders the breakdown card.

USE APPS

#### KYC Identity Check

Complex multi-step wizard. The compliance team owns the flow. Ships as MCP App — they control the UX without touching the copilot shell.

USE TOOLS

#### Transaction History

Paginated data. Host app renders a standard table component. No benefit to an iframe for this use case.

USE APPS

#### FX Rate Booking

Live rate ticker, tenor picker, confirmation step. Markets desk team ships this as MCP App. Tight domain ownership. Interactive and stateful.

USE TOOLS

#### AML Sanctions Check

Binary pass/fail with explanation. Returns JSON verdict. Agent interprets and presents. Simple, auditable, no UI complexity needed.

USE HYBRID

#### Loan Application

Data gathering via MCP Tools (credit bureau query, income check) + MCP App for the multi-page application form with document upload.

USE TOOLS

#### Regulatory Limit Check

Returns structured compliance verdict. Agent includes it in reasoning chain. No UI surface needed — background orchestration step.

## Recommended Strategy: Tiered Hybrid

For the EU bank platform, use a **two-tier MCP strategy**. **MCP Tools** are the default for all data-retrieval and background orchestration steps — they have zero iframe surface area and fit naturally within your strict CSP and OWASP controls. **MCP Apps** are reserved for domain-owned interactive workflows where a team needs to ship their own UX (payment forms, KYC wizards, FX booking) — they carry a larger security surface that the architecture explicitly manages via sandbox policy and SRI enforcement.

04 — EU Bank security fit

## Security Analysis for Regulated Context

**MCP Apps — Key Consideration for Banking** MCP Apps render external HTML/JS bundles in iframes. For a regulated EU bank, this introduces a content security policy challenge and requires explicit iframe sandboxing policy. It is solvable — but must be designed intentionally, not accepted as a default. 

### MCP Tools — Security Profile ✅

CSP Impact

Zero impact. No additional script-src or frame-src entries needed. Fully compatible with strict `default-src 'self'`.

Iframe surface

None. All rendering is native React components inside your controlled codebase. `frame-ancestors 'none'` remains unchanged.

Supply chain risk

Standard dependency audit (Snyk/Dependabot) on your React components. No runtime bundle loading from external servers.

Audit & explainability

Tool calls are discrete JSON-in/JSON-out events. Each invocation is a clean log entry. Easy to tie to regulatory audit trail.

### MCP Apps — Security Controls Required ⚠️

Iframe sandbox policy

Must set `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms"` — never `allow-same-origin`. Blocks DOM escape, cookie access, and parent-frame navigation.

CSP frame-src

Add `frame-src https://assets.bank.eu` (bank-owned CDN only). Never wildcard. Reviewed per tool registration.

SRI enforcement

Each bundle URL in Tool Registry carries a sha384 hash. MCPAppsMiddleware must verify hash before rendering. Reject mismatches.

postMessage origin check

AG-UI ↔ iframe communication via postMessage must validate `event.origin === 'https://assets.bank.eu'`. Reject all other origins.

PII boundary

MCP App iframes must never receive raw PII. Pass only opaque references (payment_id, customer_ref) — let the MCP server resolve via API.

Approval gate compatibility

Human-in-loop interrupts must work across the iframe boundary. Test Strands `interrupt_before` with MCPAppsMiddleware in staging before prod.

**Spec Maturity Note** MCP Apps was formally announced by CopilotKit in January 2026. The spec is inspired by the community's MCP-UI effort and OpenAI's Apps SDK, but is not yet an IANA-registered standard. For a regulated institution, treat MCP Apps as a "controlled preview" — deploy for internal staff-facing tools first, not customer-facing surfaces, until the spec stabilises. 

05 — Implementation patterns

## Code Patterns for Each Approach

### Pattern A — MCP Tools + CopilotKit (data lookup)
    
    
    // In your React app — useCopilotAction handles rendering
    useCopilotAction({
      name: "get_account_balance",
      description: "Fetch account balance for the authenticated customer",
      parameters: [{ name: "account_id", type: "string", required: true }],
    
      // All rendering is YOUR React component — no external bundles
      render: ({ args, status, result }) => (
        <AccountBalanceCard
          accountId={args.account_id}
          balance={result?.balance}
          currency={result?.currency}
          status={status}          // "inProgress" | "complete" | "error"
        />
      ),
    
      handler: async (args) => {
        // Goes to BFF → AgentCore → Strands → MCP Tool
        return await bffClient.post("/copilot/tool", args);
      },
    });
        

### Pattern B — MCP Apps (payment form — domain team owns UI)
    
    
    // In your Next.js BFF / agent runtime — attach MCPAppsMiddleware
    // The payment domain team's MCP server ships its OWN form UI
    
    import { MCPAppsMiddleware } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
    
    const middleware = MCPAppsMiddleware({
      mcpServers: [
        {
          url: "https://mcp-payment.internal.agentcore.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",
          transport: "streamable-http",
          // Bank-owned CDN — never external. SRI enforced by middleware
          allowedBundleOrigin: "https://assets.bank.eu",
          sandboxPolicy: "allow-scripts allow-forms",  // Never allow-same-origin
          sriRequired: true,
        }
      ],
    });
    
    // Payment domain team's MCP server registers its App like this:
    // tool description includes: ui://payment-confirm?bundle=sha384:abc...
    // CopilotKit resolves bundle from CDN, renders in sandboxed iframe
    // AG-UI syncs form state back to Strands agent for approval flow
        

### Pattern C — Hybrid in Strands agent (recommended)
    
    
    # strands_agent/agent.py — configure tool tiers explicitly
    from strands import Agent
    from mcp import MCPClient
    
    async def build_agent(session_ctx):
        registry = await ToolRegistry.fetch(session_ctx["team_id"])
    
        # Tier 1 — MCP Tools: data retrieval, background ops
        # These produce JSON. CopilotKit renders via useCopilotAction
        data_tools = await MCPClient.list_tools(
            registry.filter(type="data_tool")
        )
    
        # Tier 2 — MCP Apps: interactive domain UIs
        # These produce ui:// references. MCPAppsMiddleware renders iframes
        app_tools = await MCPClient.list_tools(
            registry.filter(type="mcp_app")
        )
    
        return Agent(
            model=BedrockModel(model_id="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet..."),
            tools=[*data_tools, *app_tools],
            # Human-in-loop: pause BEFORE any MCP App tool fires
            # This gives the approval gate a chance to validate
            interrupt_before=registry.get_gated_tool_names(),
            system_prompt=build_prompt(session_ctx),
        )

## 1. Universal Baseline Checklist

Applicable to **all organizations** deploying AI systems, regardless of sector.

  □ Designate an AI Risk Owner (typically CISO or AI Ethics Officer)
  □ Draft and approve AI Acceptable Use Policy
  □ Create AI Risk Register using NIST AI 100-2 attack taxonomy
  □ Define AI risk appetite (what automation levels are acceptable?)
  □ Establish AI governance committee (CISO, Legal, CTO, Business)

INVENTORY AND CLASSIFICATION:
  □ Inventory all AI systems currently deployed
  □ Classify each AI system by risk level (EU AI Act model)
  □ Document intended use and out-of-scope use for each system
  □ Map data flows: what data enters and exits each AI system
  □ Identify all third-party AI components (APIs, models, libraries)

IMMEDIATE SECURITY CONTROLS:
  □ Enable logging for all LLM API calls (inputs, outputs, tokens)
  □ Implement rate limiting on all AI API endpoints
  □ Add PII redaction before any data is sent to external LLM APIs
  □ Require API key rotation schedule (90-day maximum)
  □ Document which AI models have access to production data
```

### Phase 2: Core Controls (Days 30-90)

```

  □ Agent permissions: document tool permissions per agent type
  □ Human approval: mandatory human approval for high-risk agentic actions
  □ Kill switch: tested emergency stop for all AI agents
  □ Audit trail: all agent actions logged with tamper protection
```

```
ADVANCED CONTROLS:
  □ Adversarial training: fine-tuned models trained with adversarial examples
  □ Model behavior monitoring: automated drift detection operational
  □ C2PA implementation: content provenance signing for AI-generated content
  □ Inter-agent authentication: mTLS or signed messages between agents
  □ Memory integrity: cryptographic integrity protection for agent memory
  □ Red team exercise: AI-specific red team conducted against production systems

COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT:
  □ NIST AI RMF: GOVERN-MAP-MEASURE-MANAGE cycle documented and followed
  □ ISO 42001: AI management system documentation complete
  □ EU AI Act (if applicable): high-risk AI system documentation and registration

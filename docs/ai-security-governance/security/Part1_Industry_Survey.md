# Part 1: Industry Survey
How leading AI platforms implement secure enterprise integrations

Enterprise Authentication & Identity Propagation for AI Agents


## **Overview**

This section surveys ten leading enterprise AI platforms and examines how each implements authentication, authorization, connector models, identity propagation, session handling, token management, governance, audit logging, and multi-tenant isolation. Understanding these patterns is foundational before designing any production-grade AI integration.

#### **Platforms Covered**

- Google Gemini

- Claude (Anthropic)

- ChatGPT Enterprise (OpenAI)

- Microsoft 365 Copilot

- GitHub Copilot

- Amazon Q Business

- Atlassian Rovo

- ServiceNow AI Agents

- Glean

- Moveworks

## **1. Google Gemini**

Google Gemini for Workspace integrates natively with Google's identity stack. Authentication is rooted in Google Cloud Identity / Workspace Directory, leveraging the same OAuth 2.0 consent flow a user performs when granting a third-party app access to their Workspace data.

**Google Gemini — Architecture Matrix**

|**Dimension**|**Detail**|
|---|---|
|Architecture|SaaS, multi-tenant; dedicated VPC for Enterprise; data processed in Google infrastructure|
|Authentication|Google Account SSO→OAuth 2.0 with PKCE; supports SAML federation via Cloud Identity|
|Authorization|Google Workspace Admin policies; scoped OAuth consent; DLP enforced at API layer|
|Connector Model|Native Google Workspace connectors + Vertex AI extensions for third-party tools|
|Identity Propagation|Google-issued access token carries user sub claim; passed as bearer token to Google APIs|
|Session Handling|Google session cookies (SAPISID, SSID); refresh tokens stored server-side in Google Accounts|

|Token Management|Short-lived access tokens (1 h); offline refresh tokens with rotation; CAE supported|
|Governance|Admin Console policies; Context-Aware Access; BeyondCorp enforcement|
|Audit Logging|Google Workspace Audit & Investigation tool; logs streamed to Cloud Logging / Chronicle|
|Multi-Tenant Isolation|Organisation-level data isolation; Workspace Customer ID scoping; VPC Service Controls|


### **Gemini Authentication Flow**

**1** User authenticates via Google Account (SSO / SAML federation) ↓ **2** OAuth 2.0 consent screen grants Gemini app scopes (e.g. gmail.readonly) ↓ **3** Gemini runtime receives short-lived access token + refresh token ↓ **4** Each tool call attaches bearer token to Google API request ↓

**5** Token refreshed silently using stored refresh token

↓

**6** All API calls logged to Workspace Audit Log with acting-user identity

## **2. Claude — Anthropic**

Claude is available via claude.ai (consumer / Teams), the Claude API, and Claude for Enterprise. Claude for Enterprise supports SSO via SAML 2.0 and SCIM provisioning. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is Anthropic's open protocol for tool integrations, enabling Claude to connect to enterprise data sources through a standardised server interface.

### **Claude — Architecture Matrix**

||**Dimension**|**Detail**|
|---|---|---|
|Architecture||Hosted SaaS; API-first; MCP servers deployed in customer infrastructure or Anthropic-hosted|


|**Dimension**|**Detail**|
|---|---|
|Authentication|SAML 2.0 SSO (Okta, Entra ID, Ping); SCIM provisioning; API key for programmatic access|
|Authorization|Admin-configurable tool permissions; MCP server enforces its own authz; no elevation by design|
|Connector Model|MCP (Model Context Protocol) — open standard; connectors are MCP servers exposing tool schemas|
|Identity Propagation|MCP server receives user context via HTTP headers or JWT; each MCP call can carry user identity|
|Session Handling|Web session via browser cookie; API sessions stateless per request; conversation context in prompt|
|Token Management|API keys long-lived; OAuth tokens managed by MCP server; Anthropic does not store third-party tokens|
|Governance|Enterprise policy controls (tool allow-list, data retention); Admin API for user management|
|Audit Logging|Admin audit log for user/admin actions; MCP server responsible for tool-level audit|
|Multi-Tenant Isolation|Organisation-scoped API keys; workspace isolation; SCIM-managed user directories|


### **MCP Identity Flow**

When Claude invokes an MCP tool, the MCP server is responsible for authenticating the call. Anthropic recommends that MCP servers validate the user identity header injected by the Claude platform, then exchange it for the user's own OAuth token via an On-Behalf-Of (OBO) pattern before calling downstream APIs. This ensures the downstream API always sees the end-user's identity, not a service account.

#### **Key MCP Security Principles**

- MCP servers MUST NOT accept arbitrary tool calls without validating caller identity

- User identity propagation via signed JWT or MCP authorization header

- MCP servers enforce least-privilege scopes independently of Claude

- All tool invocations should be logged with correlation to conversation ID

- Anthropic publishes the MCP specification at modelcontextprotocol.io

## **3. ChatGPT Enterprise — OpenAI**

ChatGPT Enterprise provides SSO, data encryption, audit logs, and a no-training commitment. GPT Actions extend the model with OAuth-protected API integrations. The Responses API and Assistants API add stateful session management for production agent deployments.


### **ChatGPT Enterprise — Architecture Matrix**

|**Dimension**|**Detail**|
|---|---|
|Architecture|Hosted SaaS; Enterprise dedicated deployment option; data processed in OpenAI infrastructure|
|Authentication|SAML 2.0 SSO; SCIM provisioning; Service Accounts for automation|
|Authorization|Workspace admin controls; GPT Action-level OAuth scope configuration; no RAG data sharing cross-org|
|Connector Model|GPT Actions (OpenAPI schema + OAuth); Assistants API function calling; Responses API tools|
|Identity Propagation|GPT Action OAuth: user consent issues user's own token to Action; OpenAI passes it to API|
|Session Handling|Browser session (HttpOnly cookies); Assistants API thread IDs for stateful conversations|
|Token Management|OAuth tokens for Actions stored encrypted by OpenAI; short-lived access tokens with refresh|
|Governance|Admin dashboard; workspace-level GPT publishing controls; data residency options|
|Audit Logging|Admin audit log (user logins, GPT usage); exportable; retention configurable|
|Multi-Tenant Isolation|Workspace-scoped data; enterprise storage separate from consumer; no cross-workspace data|


## **4. Microsoft 365 Copilot**

Microsoft 365 Copilot is the most deeply integrated enterprise AI platform from an identity perspective. It is built entirely on Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Microsoft Graph, and the Microsoft identity platform. Copilot always acts on behalf of the signed-in user, using OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of (OBO) to call Microsoft Graph APIs.

### **Microsoft 365 Copilot — Architecture Matrix**

||**Dimension**|**Detail**|
|---|---|---|
|Architecture||Integrated into M365 SaaS; Azure-hosted; Entra ID as authoritative IdP; Graph as API layer|
|Authentication||Microsoft Entra ID; SAML / OIDC / Kerberos for hybrid; MFA enforced via Conditional Access|
|Authorization||Microsoft Graph permissions (delegated); Entra Conditional Access policies; Sensitivity Labels|


|**Dimension**|**Detail**|
|---|---|
|Connector Model|Microsoft Graph Connectors; Teams Message Extensions; Power Platform connectors; Plugins|
|Identity Propagation|Entra ID issues delegated access token; Copilot passes user's token to Graph — never service acct|
|Session Handling|MSAL session tokens cached client-side (MSAL.js) and server-side; CAE for real-time revocation|
|Token Management|Short-lived access tokens (60-90 min); refresh tokens up to 90 days; CAE extends to event-based|
|Governance|Microsoft Purview (DLP, sensitivity labels, retention); Compliance Manager; eDiscovery|
|Audit Logging|Microsoft Purview Audit (Standard / Premium); Copilot activity logs in Unified Audit Log (UAL)|
|Multi-Tenant Isolation|Entra tenant isolation; no cross-tenant data without explicit External Identities config|


### **M365 Copilot OBO Flow**

|**1**|User signs in to M365 with Entra ID credentials (MFA enforced)|
|---|---|
|↓||
|**2**|Entra ID issues OIDC ID token + OAuth access token for Microsoft Graph|
|↓||
|**3**|Copilot receives user access token (delegated permission, not application permission)|
|↓||
|**4**|Copilot sends user query + access token to Azure OpenAI Service|
|↓||
|**5**|Copilot uses OBO flow to obtain scoped Graph token for each required resource|
|↓||
|**6**|Graph API enforces user's permissions (SharePoint, Teams, Exchange, etc.)|
|↓||
|**7**|All Copilot actions logged to Unified Audit Log under the signed-in user's UPN|


#### **Why Microsoft's OBO Implementation Matters**

- Access token is always delegated — not application-level (no implicit elevation)

- Copilot cannot access files the user cannot access

- Sensitivity labels enforced at Graph layer even if Copilot requests content

- CAE (Continuous Access Evaluation) revokes tokens in near-real-time on policy change

- Purview DLP policies apply to Copilot output, preventing data exfiltration

## **5. GitHub Copilot**

GitHub Copilot operates within the GitHub ecosystem, meaning identity flows through GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) authentication. The IDE extension authenticates once via OAuth Device Flow and caches a GitHub access token. Copilot extensions (preview) allow third-party agents to integrate via the GitHub Copilot Extensions API.

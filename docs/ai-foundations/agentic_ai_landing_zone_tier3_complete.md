# TIER 3: ADVANCED CAPABILITIES (Condensed)

*These four interconnected pillars complete the enterprise platform.*

---

## 1. AGENT IDENTITY & TRUST ARCHITECTURE

### The Identity Problem

Agents need cryptographic identity to:
- ✅ Prove they are who they claim to be (authentication)
- ✅ Access resources with appropriate permissions (authorization)  
- ✅ Delegate authority to other agents (delegation)
- ✅ Be audited (attribution)
- ✅ Revoke credentials if compromised (revocation)

### Identity Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AGENT IDENTITY INFRASTRUCTURE           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  1. Agent Identity Registry             │
│     ├─ DID (Decentralized Identifier)   │
│     ├─ Public key / Certificate         │
│     ├─ Capabilities declaration         │
│     └─ Trust relationships               │
│                                         │
│  2. Authentication                      │
│     ├─ mTLS (mutual TLS)                │
│     ├─ OAuth 2.0 / OIDC                 │
│     ├─ SPIFFE (workload identity)       │
│     └─ JWT tokens (proof of identity)   │
│                                         │
│  3. Authorization                       │
│     ├─ Fine-grained permissions         │
│     ├─ Role-based (RBAC)                │
│     ├─ Attribute-based (ABAC)           │
│     └─ Policy-based (Rego, Cedar)       │
│                                         │
│  4. Delegation & Impersonation          │
│     ├─ On-behalf-of flows               │
│     ├─ Token exchange (STS)              │
│     ├─ Capability delegation            │
│     └─ Transitive trust                 │
│                                         │
│  5. Audit & Revocation                  │
│     ├─ Immutable audit trail            │
│     ├─ Certificate revocation (CRL)     │
│     ├─ Real-time permission updates     │
│     └─ Compliance reporting             │
│                                         │

```

### Example: Agent Making a Decision

```
Agent: customer-service-v2.4
Identity: arn:aws:agents:us-east-1:123456789:agent/customer-service-v2.4

Step 1: Get Credentials
└─ Request access token from STS
   ├─ Prove identity: mTLS certificate + DID signature
   └─ Receive JWT token: {agent_id, capabilities, ttl: 1 hour}

Step 2: Check Authorization
└─ Agent wants to access customer_db.query
   ├─ Policy engine checks: "customer-service-v2.4" → allowed?
   ├─ Policy: "Can read customer_db, no write"
   └─ Decision: ✅ ALLOW

Step 3: Make Decision
└─ Agent uses LLM to decide: approve refund?
   ├─ Policy constraint: Max refund = $1,000
   └─ Agent decision: "$500 refund" ✓ (within constraint)

Step 4: Audit Trail
└─ Log entry (cryptographically signed):
   ├─ Agent: customer-service-v2.4
   ├─ Action: approved refund of $500
   ├─ Policy: refund-policy-v3.2
   ├─ Timestamp: 2026-07-09T16:30:45Z
   ├─ Signature: sha256(evidence)
   └─ Retention: 7 years (GDPR)
```

## 2. AI FINOPS: COST GOVERNANCE

### The Cost Problem

```
Scenario: You deploy 50 agents

WITHOUT FinOps:
├─ Month 1: $25K model API costs (expected)
├─ Month 2: $45K (someone deployed a chatbot)
├─ Month 3: $120K (unoptimized context loading)
├─ Month 4: $350K (query loop bug in production)
└─ Year: $2.1M (no visibility, out of control)

WITH FinOps:
├─ Budget: $100K/month per business unit
├─ Agent 1 (customer service): $15K (within budget ✓)
├─ Agent 2 (research): $12K (within budget ✓)
├─ Agent 3 (new): $35K (over budget! ⚠️ investigate)
└─ Year: $1.2M (controlled, optimized, predictable)
```

### Cost Attribution Model

```
TOTAL AGENT COST = Model + Context + Compute + Storage + Support

Example: Customer Service Agent
├─ Model inference: $18K/month
│  ├─ Claude Opus: $12K (reasoning)
│  ├─ Claude Haiku: $4K (classification)
│  └─ Local model: $2K (embeddings)
│
├─ Context loading: $4K/month
│  ├─ Vector DB queries: $2K
│  ├─ Database queries: $1K
│  └─ API calls for context: $1K
│
├─ Compute: $6K/month
│  ├─ Runtime pods: $4K
│  ├─ Inference accelerators: $1.5K
│  └─ Monitoring: $0.5K
│
├─ Storage: $1.5K/month
│  ├─ Episodic memory DB: $0.8K
│  ├─ Audit logs: $0.5K
│  └─ Conversation history: $0.2K
│
└─ Support: $0.5K/month (on-call rotation)

**TOTAL: $30K/month per agent (50 agents = $1.5M/year)**
```

### FinOps Controls

```
COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:

1. Context Optimization (40% of cost reduction)
   ├─ Summarize long conversations (reduce tokens by 70%)
   ├─ Use cheaper models for context fetching (Haiku vs Opus)
   └─ Cache common queries (eliminate redundant API calls)

2. Model Selection (25% savings)
   ├─ Haiku for simple classification ($0.80 per 1M tokens)
   ├─ Sonnet for balanced tasks ($3 per 1M tokens)
   └─ Opus for complex reasoning ($15 per 1M tokens)
   └─ Choose smallest model that meets performance target

3. Batch Processing (15% savings)
   ├─ Process 1000 requests together (cheaper than 1000x individual)
   └─ Trade latency for cost (4-hour batch vs real-time)

4. Reserved Capacity (10% savings)
   ├─ Negotiate volume discounts with model providers
   ├─ Commit to $50K/month → 10-15% discount
   └─ Helps with cost predictability

5. Infrastructure Efficiency (10% savings)
   ├─ Right-size compute (don't over-provision)
   ├─ Auto-scaling (scale down during low traffic)
   └─ Spot instances (for batch/non-critical work)
```

### Cost Dashboard Example

```
MONTHLY COST TRACKING:

Agent                  Budget   Actual    %Used  Trend  Status
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Customer Service       $30K     $28.5K    95%    ↓      ✅ Green
Research (new)         $20K     $31.2K    156%   ↑      🔴 Red
Order Processing       $25K     $24.1K    96%    ↓      ✅ Green
Compliance Monitor     $15K     $14.8K    99%    ↔      ✅ Green
Technical Support      $10K     $12.3K    123%   ↑      🟠 Yellow

TOTAL                  $100K    $111K     111%   (Over budget)

ACTION: Research agent is $11K over. 
- Check for context bloat
- Optimize model selection
- Review error loop (possible infinite retry)

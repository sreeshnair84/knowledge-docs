## PART 1: AGENT CLASSIFICATION (Days 1-3)

### Step 1.1: Inventory All Agents

**Action:** List every AI agent your organization has or is developing.

```
DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
├─ Where are agents running?
│  ├─ Production systems (web, mobile, backend)
│  ├─ Internal tools (employee productivity)
│  ├─ Experimental/pilot projects
│  ├─ Shadow systems (teams built without IT approval)
│  └─ Proof-of-concepts (not yet deployed)
│
├─ Who knows about them?
│  ├─ Official IT/AI team
│  ├─ Business units (Finance, HR, Operations)
│  ├─ Skunkworks/innovation teams
│  ├─ Individual engineers (personal projects)
│  └─ External agencies (outsourced development)
│
└─ What are they doing?
   ├─ Customer-facing (customer service, support)
   ├─ Business-critical (approvals, decisions, transactions)
   ├─ Back-office (analytics, reporting)
   ├─ Monitoring (compliance, fraud detection)
   └─ Administrative (scheduling, notifications)
```

**Agent Inventory Template:**

```yaml
agents:
  - id: "cust-service-v2.4"
    name: "Customer Service Chatbot"
    status: "production"
    owner: "Customer Operations"
    users: "100K+ customers/month"

  - id: "loan-approval-v1.0"
    name: "Loan Decisioning Agent"
    status: "staging"
    owner: "Credit Risk"
    users: "Processing ~500 loans/day"

  - id: "compliance-monitor-v1"
    name: "Regulatory Compliance Monitor"
    status: "production"
    owner: "Compliance & Risk"
    users: "Internal (monitoring ~200 transactions/hour)"

  - id: "research-assistant-pilot"
    name: "Research & Market Intelligence"
    status: "pilot"
    owner: "Strategy Team"
    users: "Internal (10 users in pilot)"

  # ... continue for all agents
```

**Timeline:** 1-2 days (depends on organization size)

---

### Step 1.2: Classify Each Agent

**EU AI Act Risk Framework:**

| Risk Level | Definition | Requirements | Examples |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| **UNACCEPTABLE** | Prohibited systems | ❌ BANNED (remove immediately) | Social credit scoring, manipulation, subliminal techniques |
| **HIGH-RISK** (Annex III) | Critical systems needing conformity assessment | ⚠️ MUST COMPLY by Aug 2 | Lending decisions, employment screening, law enforcement tools, critical infrastructure |
| **LIMITED-RISK** | Transparency required | ⚠️ MUST DISCLOSE by Aug 2 | Chatbots, content generation, recommendation systems |
| **MINIMAL-RISK** | No specific requirements | ✅ No immediate action | Spam filters, autocorrect, simple analytics |

### Classification Decision Tree

```
Does your agent make decisions affecting fundamental rights?
│
├─ YES → HIGH-RISK (Annex III)
│  ├─ Employment (hiring, firing, promotion, salary)
│  ├─ Credit/finance (loan approval, credit scoring, pricing)
│  ├─ Law enforcement (arrest, investigation, prosecution)
│  ├─ Border control (visa, entry decisions)
│  ├─ Safety-critical infrastructure (power grids, transport)
│  ├─ Migration/asylum (visa, entry, asylum decisions)
│  └─ Justice system (criminal sentencing, bail decisions)
│
└─ NO → Next question
   │
   ├─ Does your agent interact with humans/users?
   │  ├─ YES → LIMITED-RISK (transparency required)
   │  │  ├─ Chatbots
   │  │  ├─ Recommendation systems
   │  │  ├─ Content generation/summarization
   │  │  └─ Virtual assistants
   │  │
   │  └─ NO → MINIMAL-RISK (no special requirements)
   │     ├─ Spam filters
   │     ├─ Internal analytics
   │     └─ Log analysis
```

### Classification Template

Fill this out for **EACH agent**:

```yaml
classification:
  agent_id: "loan-approval-v1.0"
  agent_name: "Loan Decisioning Agent"

  risk_assessment:
    # Does it affect fundamental rights?
    affects_fundamental_rights: true
    # Which rights? (employment, credit, justice, migration, safety, etc.)
    rights_affected: ["credit_access", "financial_wellbeing"]

    # Is it a use case in Annex III?
    in_annex_iii: true
    annex_iii_category: "Credit provision (4.1)"

    # Final classification
    risk_level: "HIGH-RISK"
    requires_conformity_assessment: true
    compliance_deadline: "2026-08-02"

  decision_impact:
    # How many people affected?
    users_affected: 500  # loans/day × 250 days/year

    # What are the consequences of wrong decisions?
    consequences_of_error: "Loan rejection (financial harm), unfair treatment"

    # Can user appeal or understand why?
    explainability_required: true
    appeals_process_required: true

  remediation:
    # Can you fix this before Aug 2?
    compliance_possible: true
    estimated_effort: "3-4 weeks"
    priority: "CRITICAL"
```

**Timeline:** 1 day (mark all high-risk agents)

---

## PART 2: HIGH-RISK AGENT AUDIT (Days 4-10)

### Step 2.1: For Each High-Risk Agent, Complete Audit

**High-Risk Requirements (EU AI Act, Article 8-51):**

```
REQUIREMENT                        STATUS    EVIDENCE NEEDED
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Risk Management System          [ ]       Documentation
2. Data Governance & Quality       [ ]       Data collection logs
3. Technical Documentation         [ ]       Architecture, code, models
4. Record-Keeping                  [ ]       Audit logs, decision logs
5. Transparency & Information      [ ]       User-facing disclosures
6. Human Oversight & Appeal        [ ]       Process documentation
7. Robustness & Accuracy           [ ]       Test results, metrics
8. Incident Response Plan          [ ]       Runbook, escalation
```

### Step 2.2: Risk Management System

**What is it?** A documented process showing how you identify, assess, and mitigate risks.

**Template:**

```markdown
# Risk Management System for [Agent Name]

## 1. Risk Identification
### Known Risks:
- **Risk 1**: Model bias against [protected class]
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: High (loan rejections)
  - Mitigation: [What you're doing]

- **Risk 2**: Hallucinated justifications (model invents reasons for decisions)
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: Medium (poor customer experience)
  - Mitigation: [What you're doing]

- **Risk 3**: Adversarial inputs (someone tricks agent into wrong decision)
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: High (fraud)
  - Mitigation: [What you're doing]

### How you identified risks:
- Threat modeling session (date)
- Expert interviews (CISO, compliance, business stakeholders)
- Literature review (known LLM/AI risks)
- Historical incidents (if any)

## 2. Risk Assessment
For each risk:
├─ Probability (Low/Medium/High)
├─ Severity (Low/Medium/High)
├─ Risk Score = Probability × Severity
└─ Tolerance Level (acceptable?)

## 3. Risk Mitigation
For each HIGH-risk item:
├─ Technical controls (code, model, data)
├─ Organizational controls (policies, processes)
├─ Monitoring (how to detect when mitigation fails)
└─ Response (what to do if risk materializes)

Example Mitigation:
Risk: Bias against women in loan decisions
├─ Technical: Debiasing at training time + post-hoc fairness checks
├─ Organizational: Quarterly bias audits, mandatory accuracy testing
├─ Monitoring: Track approval rates by gender (daily dashboard)
└─ Response: If disparity > 5%, escalate to Chief Risk Officer

## 4. Ongoing Monitoring
- Frequency: Daily (for production agent)
- Metrics: Accuracy, fairness, drift detection
- Escalation: If any metric out of bounds
- Review: Quarterly risk reassessment
```

### Step 2.3: Data Governance & Quality

**What is it?** Evidence that your training/operational data is fit for purpose.

**Requirements:**

```
✓ Data collection documented (where did data come from?)
✓ Data quality checked (is it accurate, complete, representative?)
✓ Bias assessment (does data reflect historical discrimination?)
✓ Privacy controls (is sensitive data protected?)
✓ Data retention (how long do you keep data?)
```

**Documentation Template:**

```yaml
data_governance:
  agent: "loan-approval-v1.0"

  training_data:
    source: "Historical loan decisions (2020-2025)"
    volume: "50,000 approved loans + 30,000 rejected loans"

    quality_assurance:
      completeness: "99.2% (0.8% missing fields)"
      accuracy: "Audited by compliance team (spot-check 500 records)"
      timeliness: "Data refreshed monthly"

    bias_assessment:
      protected_classes_checked: ["gender", "age", "race", "disability"]
      disparate_impact_test: "Passed (approval rate difference < 5%)"
      mitigation: "Removed proxy features (zip code, name) that correlate with protected class"

    privacy_controls:
      pii_handling: "Social Security numbers encrypted at rest, masked in logs"
      data_minimization: "Only features required for prediction"
      retention: "Deleted after 7 years (GDPR compliance)"

  operational_data:
    # What data does agent see in production?
    sources:
      - loan_application_db
      - credit_score_api
      - income_verification_service

    freshness: "Real-time (within 5 minutes)"
    validation: "Automated schema validation before inference"
    pii_protection: "Customer SSN masked, only last 4 digits used"
```

### Step 2.4: Technical Documentation

**What is it?** Detailed description of how your system works.

**Checklist:**

```
✓ System Architecture Diagram
  ├─ Components (agent, model, databases, APIs)
  ├─ Data flows
  └─ Decision points

✓ Model Card
  ├─ Model name, version, last update
  ├─ Intended use (what decisions?)
  ├─ Training data (what? how much?)
  ├─ Performance metrics (accuracy by subgroup)
  ├─ Known limitations & failure modes
  └─ Bias testing results

✓ Decision Logic Documentation
  ├─ Input requirements
  ├─ Processing steps
  ├─ Policy/rule constraints
  ├─ Output format & explanations
  └─ Escalation criteria (when to send to human)

✓ API Specifications

  ├─ Response format
  ├─ Error codes
  └─ Rate limits

✓ Code Quality Documentation
  ├─ Static analysis results
  ├─ Security scanning results
  ├─ Test coverage (unit, integration, end-to-end)
  └─ Known vulnerabilities (and fixes)
```

### Step 2.5: Record-Keeping & Audit Logs

**What is it?** Immutable record of every decision and rationale.

**Requirements:**

```
For each decision made by agent:
├─ Timestamp
├─ Input data (what did agent see?)
├─ Agent ID & version
├─ Decision made
├─ Confidence/probability
├─ Explanation/reasoning (why this decision?)
├─ User identity (who requested?)
├─ Data sources consulted
└─ Outcome (if known: was decision correct?)

Audit Log Must:
✓ Be immutable (can't be edited after creation)
✓ Be cryptographically signed (tamper detection)
✓ Be retained for 7 years (GDPR requirement)
✓ Be accessible to regulators/auditors
✓ Be queryable (can find decisions affecting specific person)
```

**Implementation Example:**

```json

    "policy_satisfied": true,
    "constraints": "No issues detected"
  },

  "human_review": {
    "required": false,
    "status": "N/A"
  },

  "user_context": {
    "user_id": "advisor-456",
    "organization": "Wealth Management Division"
  },

  "signature": "sha256:abc123...", // Cryptographic signature
  "retention_until": "2033-07-09"  // 7-year retention
}
```

**Timeline:** 3-5 days (most effort)

─────────────────────────────────────
```

### Disclosure Requirements Checklist

For each agent, ensure users see:

```
✓ Clear statement: "This decision was made by AI"
✓ What AI did: "Analyzed your application to determine eligibility"
✓ Limitations: "AI can make mistakes; not perfect"
✓ Human option: "You can request review by a human"
✓ Appeal process: "You can appeal this decision"
✓ Privacy: "Your data is protected [link to privacy policy]"

```

**Timeline:** 2-3 days (website/app changes)

---

## PART 4: HUMAN OVERSIGHT & APPEALS (Days 11-18)

### Requirement: Humans Must Review High-Risk Decisions

**When is human review required?**

```
Always:
├─ First-time user (new customer)
├─ High-value decisions (> $100K)
├─ Refusal/rejection decisions (deny loan, no hire)
└─ Complaint/appeal requests

Sometimes:
├─ Low confidence scores (< 70%)
├─ Unusual patterns detected
└─ Customer explicitly requests human review

Never (if all conditions met):
└─ Routine approval, returning customer, low-risk
```

### Human Review SLA

**Template:**

```
HIGH-RISK AGENT: Loan Approval

Human Review SLA:
├─ First-time decisions: < 24 hours
├─ Appeals/complaints: < 48 hours
├─ Escalations: < 4 hours
└─ Critical cases: < 1 hour

Process:
1. Agent makes decision + confidence score
2. If confidence < 75%: Queue for human review
3. Human reviews: Input data, decision, reasoning
4. Human decides: Approve, modify, or reject agent decision
5. Final decision made by human (agent is input, not authority)
6. Document: Why human agreed/disagreed with agent
```

### Appeals Process Documentation

**What you need:**

```markdown
# Appeals Process for [Agent Name]

## User Rights:
1. Right to explanation (why was I rejected?)
2. Right to appeal (I disagree with this decision)
3. Right to human review (I want a human to reconsider)
4. Right to know (what data was used?)

## How to Appeal:
1. Click "Appeal this decision" in notification
2. Provide reason for appeal
3. Submit supporting documents
4. AI review team receives appeal
5. Human decision-maker reviews within SLA
6. You receive explanation of human's decision

## Typical Appeal Timeline:
- Day 1: You submit appeal
- Days 2-3: Human review
- Day 4: You receive decision
- Day 5+: If still disagreed, escalate to executive review

## Success Rate:
- ~15% of appeals result in decision reversal

## REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: HIGH-RISK Agent (Loan Approval)

```
Your Agent: Loan decisioning (approves/rejects loans)
EU AI Act Classification: HIGH-RISK (Annex III)
Compliance Deadline: August 2, 2026

What you MUST have:
✓ Risk management system (documented risks + mitigations)
✓ Data governance (training data quality, bias testing)
✓ Technical documentation (how system works)
✓ Audit logs (every decision + reasoning + signature)
✓ Transparency (users know AI made decision)
✓ Human oversight (human can review/override)
✓ Appeals process (users can request review)
✓ Bias monitoring (daily fairness checks)

If you DON'T have all 8 items by Aug 2:
❌ System cannot be deployed/operated
❌ Regulator can fine you €35M or 7% turnover
❌ Potential criminal liability for executives

Action Plan:
├─ Days 1-3: Document risk management system
├─ Days 4-7: Complete data governance audit
├─ Days 8-11: Finish technical documentation
├─ Days 12-14: Implement audit logging
├─ Days 15-18: Add transparency + human oversight
├─ Days 19-24: Monitor + audit readiness
└─ Day 25+: Ongoing compliance
```

### Scenario 2: LIMITED-RISK Agent (Chatbot)

```
Your Agent: Customer service chatbot
EU AI Act Classification: LIMITED-RISK
Compliance Deadline: August 2, 2026

What you MUST have:
✓ Transparency (users know they're talking to AI)
✓ Privacy policy (how you use their data)
✓ Disclosure of limitations ("I can make mistakes")

What you DON'T need (unlike high-risk):
❌ Full risk management system (simpler)
❌ Human appeal process (no decisions being made)
❌ Audit logs (not required)
❌ Bias audits (lower stakes)

Action Plan:
├─ Days 1-2: Add disclosure to chat interface
├─ Days 3-4: Update privacy policy
└─ Days 5+: Monitor for issues
```

### Scenario 3: UNACCEPTABLE Agent (Social Scoring)

```
Your Agent: Scores customers on "trustworthiness" for credit
EU AI Act Classification: UNACCEPTABLE (Article 5)
Compliance Deadline: August 2, 2026

What you MUST do:
❌ STOP using this system immediately
❌ REMOVE it from production
❌ NOTIFY affected customers
❌ DELETE all score data

Why:
- EU AI Act prohibits "social scoring"
- This violates human dignity
- Penalties are criminal + €35M fine
- No amount of documentation makes this legal

Action Plan:
├─ Day 1: Executive decision to discontinue
├─ Day 2-3: Plan migration to alternative system
├─ Day 4-7: Notify customers affected
├─ Day 8-14: Delete personal data
└─ Day 15+: Audit trail to prove deletion
```

## IF YOU MISS THE DEADLINE

**What happens August 3?**

1. **Article 50 Enforcement Begins**
   - Regulators can audit your systems
   - You must prove compliance within 14 days

2. **Potential Penalties**
   - €35M or 7% of annual global revenue (whichever is higher)
   - For large orgs: could be €500M+
   - Criminal liability for executives (France, Germany)

3. **Remediation Path**
   - Demonstrate good-faith effort (started before deadline)
   - Implement compliance plan within grace period
   - Regulators often give 30-90 day remediation window if you show effort

**Recommendation:**
> Even if you're not 100% done by Aug 2, have evidence that you started in good faith. A partial compliance plan with demonstrable progress is better than nothing.

# EVALUATION FRAMEWORK: From Lab to Production

*Production agentic AI requires systematic evaluation at every stage: design, staging, deployment, operations.*

---

## Why Evaluation Matters

**Production Reality (2026):**
- 92% of agentic AI failures happen post-deployment, not in testing
- Most orgs skip evaluation, deploy based on "feels right"
- Average cost of a production incident: $50K–$500K (via wrong decisions)
- Regulatory audits now require documented evaluation evidence (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, EU AI Act)

**Evaluation Strategy:**
Systematic testing across multiple dimensions (accuracy, safety, fairness, cost) at multiple stages (design, staging, canary, production).

---

## EVALUATION LIFECYCLE

```
STAGE 1: DESIGN-TIME EVALUATION (Pre-coding)
├─ Does this idea even work?
├─ Method: Manual reasoning, expert review, thought experiments
└─ Decision: Proceed with design or pivot?
    ↓
STAGE 2: OFFLINE EVALUATION (Lab, synthetic data)
├─ Does the agent work in controlled conditions?
├─ Method: Golden dataset, synthetic test cases, benchmarks
├─ Decision: Ready for staging or need prompt/model changes?
└─ Cost: ~hours, minimal
    ↓
STAGE 3: STAGING EVALUATION (Pre-prod environment)
├─ Does the agent work with real data (but no real users)?
├─ Method: Replay production data, simulated users, load testing
├─ Decision: Ready for canary deployment or need fixes?
└─ Cost: ~1 day, moderate
    ↓
STAGE 4: CANARY EVALUATION (1-5% real traffic)
├─ Does the agent work with real users, real-time?
├─ Method: Shadow mode, A/B testing, real-time metrics
├─ Decision: Proceed to 100% or rollback?
└─ Cost: ~4 hours, real traffic
    ↓
STAGE 5: PRODUCTION EVALUATION (100% traffic)
├─ Is the agent maintaining quality over time?
├─ Method: Continuous monitoring, anomaly detection, user feedback
├─ Decision: Keep running, scale, or deprecate?
└─ Cost: Ongoing, operational
    ↓
STAGE 6: FORENSIC EVALUATION (Post-incident)
├─ What went wrong?
├─ Method: Root cause analysis, replay problematic scenarios
└─ Decision: How to prevent recurrence?
```

## GOLDEN DATASET: The Foundation

### What is a Golden Dataset?

**A curated collection of test cases** representing real scenarios that the agent must handle correctly.

```yaml
Golden Dataset: "Customer Service Agent v2.4"

Format:
├─ Input: User request (e.g., "Can I return my order?")
├─ Context: Agent context (customer data, order info)
├─ Expected Output: Correct agent response (e.g., "Yes, you have 30 days")
├─ Success Criteria: How to judge if response is correct
└─ Metadata: Difficulty, category, business impact

Example:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ID: CS-001
Category: Happy Path
Difficulty: Easy
Input: "What's my order status?"
Context: {customer_id: 12345, order_id: 98765, status: "shipped"}
Expected: "Your order 98765 is currently shipped and will arrive by July 12"
Success: Response mentions order ID, status, and ETA
Coverage: Basic happy path ✓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ID: CS-047
Category: Edge Case / High Impact
Difficulty: Hard
Input: "I want to return my order"
Context: {customer_id: 12345, order_id: 98765, return_window_days: 5, 
          days_purchased: 8, return_policy: "30 days for eligible items"}
Expected: "Unfortunately, your order is outside the 30-day return window.
          However, I can escalate this to our supervisor if you'd like."
Success: Acknowledges return request ✓
         Provides reason (outside window) ✓
         Offers escalation path ✓
Coverage: Policy boundary, escalation ✓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Building a Golden Dataset

#### Step 1: Identify Scenarios

```
Business Process Mapping:
├─ Happy paths: What should normally happen? (70% of traffic)
├─ Edge cases: What unusual situations occur? (20%)
├─ Error cases: What goes wrong? (10%)
└─ Compliance cases: What scenarios require audit? (mandatory)

Customer Service Agent Scenarios:
├─ Happy Path (70%)
│  ├─ CS-001: Basic order status
│  ├─ CS-002: Simple return request
│  └─ CS-003: Billing question
│  
├─ Edge Cases (20%)
│  ├─ CS-047: Return outside window (policy boundary)
│  ├─ CS-048: Multiple orders (ambiguous reference)
│  └─ CS-049: High-value order (escalation needed)
│  
├─ Error Cases (10%)
│  ├─ CS-080: Invalid customer ID (defensive)
│  ├─ CS-081: Malformed request (robustness)
│  └─ CS-082: Hostile/abusive input (safety)
│  
└─ Compliance (Mandatory)
   ├─ CS-200: GDPR deletion request
   ├─ CS-201: PII handling
   └─ CS-202: Audit log completeness
```

#### Step 2: Collect Real Examples

```
Data Sources:
├─ Customer feedback / surveys (what users actually ask)
├─ Support team transcripts (real conversations)
├─ Known bugs / past incidents (don't repeat)
├─ Competitor benchmarks (what should we handle?)
└─ Regulatory requirements (compliance cases)

Example Collection:
├─ Audit past 1000 support tickets
├─ Identify top 50 distinct scenarios
├─ For each scenario: collect 3-5 real examples
├─ Total: ~200 test cases (good starting point)
```

#### Step 3: Annotate with Expected Outputs

```
For Each Test Case:
├─ What should the agent say/do? (expected output)
├─ Why is this the right response? (reasoning)
├─ How to judge if agent got it right? (success criteria)
└─ Who owns this test case? (for updates)

Example Annotation:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ID: CS-047
Input: "I want to return my order"
...
Expected Response:
  "I'd be happy to help. Let me check your order.
   Your order was placed 8 days ago and qualifies for our standard 30-day 
   return window. Here's how to process your return: [steps]. 
   Would you like me to start a return now?"

Success Criteria:
  ✓ Identifies return request
  ✓ Checks return window (8 days < 30 days)
  ✓ Confirms eligibility (true)
  ✓ Provides next steps
  ✓ Offers to proceed
  ✓ No hallucinated policies
  ✓ Tone is helpful, not defensive

## OFFLINE EVALUATION: Lab Testing

### Evaluation Metrics Framework

#### Accuracy Metrics

```yaml
Task Success Rate:
  Definition: % of test cases where agent completes task correctly
  Formula: (successful_tasks / total_tasks) × 100
  Target: > 95%
  
  Example:
  ├─ Total test cases: 200
  ├─ Passed: 195
  ├─ Success rate: 97.5% ✓
  └─ Failed cases: 5 (need investigation)

Semantic Similarity:
  Definition: How similar is agent response to expected output?
  Method: Embedding similarity (cosine distance)
  Range: 0.0 (completely different) to 1.0 (identical)
  Target: > 0.85
  
  Use case: When multiple correct answers exist
  ├─ Expected: "Your order will arrive July 12"
  ├─ Agent response: "Delivery expected by July 12th"
  ├─ Similarity: 0.92 (close enough) ✓
  └─ Pass or fail based on threshold

Accuracy by Category:
  Track success rate by test category
  ├─ Happy path: 98% (simple cases)
  ├─ Edge cases: 92% (complex logic)
  ├─ Compliance: 100% (must be perfect)
  ├─ Error cases: 88% (defensive programming)
  └─ Overall: 95%
```

#### Safety & Compliance Metrics

```yaml
Hallucination Rate:
  Definition: % of responses containing false or made-up information
  Target: < 2%
  
  Examples of hallucinations:
  ├─ "Your order will definitely ship today" (made up)
  ├─ "Our return window is 45 days" (policy says 30)
  ├─ "I personally reviewed your case" (agent is not human)
  └─ Customer ID "12345" references person without verification (wrong identity)
  
  Detection:
  ├─ Automated: Regular expressions (e.g., "definitely", "guarantee")
  ├─ Manual review: Human reads 10% of outputs
  └─ User feedback: Flag "this is wrong" responses

Policy Compliance:
  Definition: % of responses adhering to company policies
  Policies checked:
  ├─ Return policy (window, conditions)
  ├─ Pricing (no unauthorized discounts)
  ├─ Data handling (no SSN sharing)
  ├─ Tone (professional, empathetic)
  ├─ Escalation (when required)
  └─ Legal disclaimers (when needed)
  
  Target: 100% for high-risk policies, 98% for low-risk

PII Handling:
  Definition: Agent correctly handles sensitive personal info
  Checks:
  ├─ Never exposes credit card numbers ✓
  ├─ Masks SSN in outputs ✓
  ├─ Doesn't share medical records with unauthorized agents ✓
  └─ Logs PII access for audit ✓
  
  Target: 100% compliance (zero violations)

Escalation Detection:
  Definition: Agent correctly identifies when human is needed
  Cases:
  ├─ High-value decision (refund > $500)
  ├─ Complaint from VIP customer
  ├─ Request outside agent authority
  ├─ Angry/upset customer
  └─ Ambiguous situation
  
  Target: > 95% detection rate
```

#### Quality Metrics

```yaml
Relevance:
  Definition: Is the response relevant to the user's request?
  Method: Human judges "yes/no" for 10% of test cases
  Target: > 98%
  
  Example bad relevance:
  User: "What's my order status?"
  Agent: "Here's general info about shipping..." (not specific)
  
Conciseness:
  Definition: Response length appropriate to complexity
  Target: 
  ├─ Simple query: < 100 tokens
  ├─ Complex query: < 300 tokens
  └─ No unnecessary verbosity

Clarity:
  Definition: Can user understand the response?
  Method: Readability score, human review
  Target: Reading level ≤ 8th grade

Tone:
  Definition: Does response match brand voice?
  Check:
  ├─ Professional but friendly ✓
  ├─ Empathetic to customer frustration ✓
  ├─ Not defensive or dismissive ✓
  └─ Appropriate for interaction (formal for legal, casual for chat)
  
  Target: > 95% tone appropriateness
```

#### Fairness Metrics

```yaml
Demographic Parity:
  Definition: Agent treats different customer groups equally
  Measure:
  ├─ Success rate for high-value vs. low-value customers
  ├─ Response time for different regions
  ├─ Escalation likelihood by customer segment
  └─ Tone/politeness varies by customer type? (should not)
  
  Target: No statistical difference (p > 0.05)

Bias Detection:
  Scenarios:
  ├─ Does agent refuse request for customer of certain identity?
  ├─ Does agent give different pricing for different names?
  ├─ Does agent escalate more for certain customer types?
  └─ Does agent make stereotypical assumptions?
  
  Test:
  ├─ Run same query with different customer profiles
  ├─ Compare responses
  └─ Flag any unfair treatment

Calibration:
  Definition: Is agent confident when it should be, uncertain when needed?
  Measure: Confidence score alignment with actual accuracy
  ├─ When agent says "I'm 90% sure": Is it actually correct 90% of time?
  └─ Target: Within 5% (90% confidence ≈ 85-95% actual accuracy)
```

### Offline Evaluation Workflow

```
Run Evaluation:
├─ Load golden dataset (200 test cases)
├─ For each test case:
│  ├─ Run agent with test input + context
│  ├─ Capture output
│  ├─ Compare against expected output (automated + manual)
│  └─ Score: Pass/Fail + confidence
│
├─ Aggregate results
│  ├─ Success rate: 195/200 = 97.5%
│  ├─ Hallucination rate: 2/200 = 1.0%
│  ├─ Compliance: 198/200 = 99%
│  └─ Tone appropriateness: 198/200 = 99%
│
├─ Identify failures
│  ├─ CS-047: Expected escalation, agent tried to handle
│  ├─ CS-082: Hostile input, agent responded defensively
│  └─ CS-150: Ambiguous query, agent hallucinated
│
└─ Decision:
   ├─ If metrics ≥ targets: PASS → proceed to staging
   ├─ If metrics < targets: FAIL → fix and re-run
   └─ If edge cases failing: ESCALATION → review with team
```

## STAGING EVALUATION: Pre-Production Validation

### Staging Deployment

```
Staging Environment:
├─ Production data (anonymized/redacted for compliance)
├─ Production infrastructure (same scale as prod, smaller)
├─ No real users (internal team only)
├─ Full monitoring/observability enabled
└─ Can be destroyed and recreated

Deployment Strategy:
├─ Deploy agent alongside current version
├─ Shadow mode: Agent runs alongside production agent but output not used
├─ Collect metrics for 24 hours
├─ Compare behavior
└─ Decision: Ready for canary or needs work?
```

### Shadow Mode Evaluation

```
Shadow Mode:
├─ User query comes in
├─ Current agent responds (returned to user)
├─ Test agent responds in parallel (not returned)
├─ Both responses logged and compared
├─ Cost: Double processing, no user impact

Metrics Tracked:
├─ Task success: Does test agent give same result?
├─ Latency: Is test agent faster/slower?
├─ Cost: Cost per call difference?
├─ Errors: Does test agent fail differently?
└─ Safety: Any concerning differences?

Example Results (24 hours shadow):
├─ Task alignment: 94.2% (mostly same responses)
├─ Latency delta: Test agent 15% slower (acceptable)
├─ Cost delta: Test agent 10% cheaper (due to better context compression)
├─ Errors: Test agent fails on 3 edge cases (need fixes)
└─ Safety: No hallucinations detected in shadow
```

## CANARY EVALUATION: Live Traffic (1-5%)

### Canary Deployment Metrics

```
Canary Deployment:
├─ Duration: 4 hours
├─ Traffic: 5% of requests (100 agents × 5% = 5 actual users)
├─ Rollback: Automatic if error rate > 5%
├─ Monitoring: Real-time alerts

Key Metrics:
├─ Error Rate
│  ├─ Target: < 1%
│  ├─ Current: 0.3%
│  └─ Status: ✓ Healthy
│
├─ Task Success
│  ├─ Target: > 95%
│  ├─ Current: 96.1%
│  └─ Status: ✓ Slightly better
│
├─ Latency p95
│  ├─ Target: < 2000ms
│  ├─ Current: 1,850ms
│  └─ Status: ✓ Within budget
│
├─ Cost per request
│  ├─ Target: < $0.25
│  ├─ Current: $0.23
│  └─ Status: ✓ Better than expected
│
└─ User Satisfaction
   ├─ Target: > 4.0 / 5.0
   ├─ Current: 4.1 / 5.0 (from feedback)
   └─ Status: ✓ Positive

Decision After 4 Hours:
├─ All metrics healthy → PROCEED TO 100%
├─ One metric concerning → HOLD, investigate
└─ Any critical failure → ROLLBACK, fix
```

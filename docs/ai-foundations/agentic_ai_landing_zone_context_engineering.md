# Agentic AI Landing Zone: Context Engineering Layer
*Context is not a afterthought — it's the primary design constraint for production agentic AI.*

---

## Why Context Engineering?

**2026 Reality:** Agents fail not because of models, but because of context.

| Failure Mode | Root Cause | Impact |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Hallucinated facts | Incomplete context (missing knowledge sources) | Wrong decisions, customer dissatisfaction |
| Inconsistent behavior | Changing context between calls (drift) | Unpredictable, untrusted agents |
| Slow responses | Context too large (all historical data) | Latency SLA violations |
| High cost per interaction | Over-fetching context (unnecessary data) | Cost per agent grows prohibitively |
| Privacy violations | Exposed sensitive context to model | GDPR fines, reputation damage |
| Inconsistent security | Unauthenticated context access | Compliance audit failures |

**Solution:** Treat **context engineering** as a first-class architecture concern, not a prompt engineering detail.

## The Context Lifecycle

```
Business Process / User Request
    ↓ "What does this agent need to know?"
    ↓
Context Assembly (What to include)
    ├─ Identify required data sources
    ├─ Fetch data (policies, customer history, knowledge base)
    └─ Validate freshness & permissions
    ↓
Context Compression (Optimize for latency & cost)
    ├─ Summarize if >100KB
    ├─ Remove redundant fields
    └─ Prioritize high-signal information
    ↓
Context Security (Enforce access control)
    ├─ Check user identity & permissions
    ├─ Redact sensitive data (PII, financial)
    ├─ Apply row-level security filters
    └─ Log context access for audit
    ↓
Context Injection (Get into prompt)
    ├─ System prompt: strategic knowledge (policies, constraints)
    ├─ User message: immediate data (customer request + context)
    └─ Examples: Few-shot examples (demonstrations of correct behavior)
    ↓
Agent Reasoning & Action
    └─ Model uses context to decide next step
    ↓
Context Refresh (Keep it fresh)
    ├─ Time-to-live (TTL): context expires in X minutes
    ├─ Trigger refresh on state changes
    ├─ Subscribe to data source updates
    └─ Detect context drift
```

---

## CONTEXT SOURCES & INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### Data Source Categories

```
STRUCTURED DATA
├─ Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
│  └─ Customer profile, order history, transaction records
│  
├─ APIs (REST, GraphQL)
│  └─ Real-time inventory, pricing, availability
│  
└─ Data Warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
    └─ Aggregated metrics, analytics, historical trends

SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA
├─ Document stores (JSON, XML)
│  └─ Product specifications, legal documents
│  
└─ Object storage (S3, Blob Storage)
    └─ Customer files, contracts, image assets

UNSTRUCTURED DATA
├─ Vector stores / Knowledge bases
│  └─ Embeddings of company policies, FAQs, documentation
│  
├─ Knowledge graphs
│  └─ Entity relationships (who reports to whom, product dependencies)
│  
└─ Logs & audit trails
    └─ Historical context (previous decisions, customer history)

REAL-TIME DATA
├─ Message queues (Kafka, Pub/Sub)
│  └─ Live inventory changes, order status
│  
├─ WebSockets / Server-sent events
│  └─ Stock prices, weather, sports scores
│  
└─ External APIs (polling)
    └─ Competitor pricing, market data
```

### Integration Pattern: MCP for Context

**Model Context Protocol** is the emerging standard for connecting agents to context sources.

```
Agent (running LangGraph)
    ↓
MCP Client
    ├─ Discovers available tools (databases, APIs, knowledge bases)
    ├─ Calls: "fetch_customer(id=12345)"
    ├─ Validates user permissions
    └─ Handles retries & errors
    ↓
MCP Server (per data source)
    ├─ Database Server: Query customer_db with row-level security
    ├─ Knowledge Server: Search embeddings in Pinecone/Weaviate
    ├─ API Server: Call REST endpoints, rate-limited
    └─ File Server: Serve documents from S3
    ↓
Response (structured, validated, logged)
    ├─ Data returned to agent
    ├─ Audit logged
    └─ Cost tracked
```

---

## CONTEXT ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Eager Context (Fetch Everything Upfront)

**When to use:** Low-complexity requests, small context size

```yaml
Agent: "User asks: What's my account balance?"

Context Assembly:
1. Fetch customer record (20KB)
2. Fetch account balances (5KB)
3. Fetch recent transactions (10KB)
4. Fetch payment methods (3KB)
────────────────────────
Total Context: ~38KB (small)
Latency: ~200ms (acceptable)

Prompt:
────────────────────────
System:
"You are a customer service agent. Help customers with account inquiries.
Current user: Customer ID 12345
Customer Status: Verified, Account Age: 5 years
Account Balance: $2,345.67
Last Transaction: 2026-07-09 10:30 (Amazon purchase $50.23)"

User:
"What's my account balance?"

Agent Output:
"Your account balance is $2,345.67. Your last transaction was..."
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Simple, predictable
- ✅ No mid-conversation delays
- ✅ Full context available for reasoning

**Cons:**

- ❌ Wastes tokens on unused context
- ❌ Latency increases with data size
- ❌ Harder to keep fresh during long conversations

---

### Strategy 2: Lazy Context (Fetch On Demand)

**When to use:** Complex requests, large potential context, need for specificity

```yaml
Agent: "User asks a complex question requiring specific data lookup"

Context Assembly:
1. System prompt loaded (2KB)
2. User query injected (1KB)

Agent Decides: "I need to check transactions and account history"
    ↓
Agent calls MCP tools on demand:
    - mcp://db/fetch_transactions(account_id, date_range)
    - mcp://kb/search(query="refund policy")

Context grows dynamically: 5KB → 15KB → 25KB

Latency: ~400ms (higher, but context is fresh)
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Only fetch what's needed
- ✅ Cost-efficient (smaller prompts)
- ✅ Can adapt to conversation flow

**Cons:**

- ❌ Introduces latency (tool calls mid-conversation)
- ❌ Harder to reason about (incomplete context initially)
- ❌ Risk of "forgotten" relevant facts

---

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Context (Smart Prefetch + On-Demand)

**Most production systems use this:**

```yaml
Agent Request: "Customer calls with a complaint"

Phase 1: Prefetch (Immediate, <100ms)
├─ Customer record (identity, account status)
├─ Recent order (most likely relevant)
└─ Cached FAQ about common issues
Total: ~15KB

Phase 2: Agent Reasoning (with prefetched context)
└─ "The customer is complaining about order X"
   "I need to check refund policy and shipping history"

Phase 3: On-Demand Fetch (if needed)
├─ Full order details (shipping, tracking)
├─ Previous refund history (patterns)
└─ Competitor return policies (context for decision)
Total Context: ~35KB by end

Latency Profile:
├─ Initial response: 150ms (prefetched)
└─ Complex reasoning: 300-500ms (lazy context added)
```

---

## CONTEXT COMPRESSION: Fit More In Less

### Problem: Context Bloat

**Scenario:** Customer asks about a product.

```
Naive Context Injection:
├─ Product DB row (500B)
├─ Customer profile (1KB)
├─ Product category (500B)
├─ Customer order history (20 orders × 500B = 10KB)
├─ Customer support tickets (50 tickets × 2KB = 100KB)
├─ Product reviews (1000 reviews × 500B = 500KB)
├─ Competitor comparison (5KB)
│
└─ TOTAL: ~625KB

Cost:
├─ Tokens used: 625KB / 0.75 bytes per token ≈ 833 tokens
├─ Input cost: 833 × $0.003 = $0.0025 per query
├─ Volume: 1000 queries/day = $2.50/day = $75/month
└─ ANNUAL COST: $900 just for context bloat
```

### Compression Techniques

#### 1. Summarization (Reduce Volume)

```yaml
BEFORE (customer history):
─────────────────────────────────────────
Order 1: 2026-06-15, $150, delivered
Order 2: 2026-06-08, $45, delivered
Order 3: 2026-06-01, $200, delivered
Order 4: 2026-05-25, $30, returned
Order 5: 2026-05-18, $175, delivered
... (20 orders total) ...

AFTER (one-line summary):
─────────────────────────────────────────
Customer has 20 orders, avg $120, 85% delivery success, 1 return history
Most recent: $150 delivered 2026-06-15

SAVINGS: From 10KB → 200 bytes (98% reduction)
```

#### 2. Prioritization (Keep High-Signal)

```yaml
CUSTOMER SUPPORT TICKETS (50 total):

Keep:
├─ Last 5 tickets (most relevant, time-ordered)
└─ Any "UNRESOLVED" tickets
Total: ~8 tickets → 16KB

Discard:
├─ Resolved tickets from 6+ months ago
├─ Duplicate/similar issues
└─ Low-severity tickets
Total: ~42 tickets → 80KB saved

Context: 100KB → 20KB (80% reduction)
```

#### 3. Semantic Filtering (Extract Meaning)

```yaml
PRODUCT REVIEWS (1000 total):

Naive: Include all reviews (500KB)

Smart: Extract themes
├─ Positive themes: "Easy setup (20%)", "Great quality (45%)"
├─ Negative themes: "Slow shipping (15%)", "Fragile packaging (10%)"
├─ Neutral: "Gray color available"
└─ Score: 4.2/5 from 1000 reviews

Semantic Summary: 2KB (vs 500KB)
```

### Compression Rules of Thumb

| Data Type | Compression Strategy | Max Size | Example |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Customer profile | Keep current, discard archived | 1KB | Name, ID, status, account age |
| Order history | Summarize, keep last 5 | 2KB | "20 orders, avg $120, 85% success" |
| Support history | Last 3 unresolved tickets | 5KB | Recent issues, last resolution |
| Product info | Full spec, drop reviews | 2KB | Features, price, inventory |
| Knowledge base hits | Top 3 documents, not all 100 | 3KB | Top FAQ answers by relevance |
| **TOTAL TARGET** | | **~15KB** | Most requests should fit here |

---

## CONTEXT SECURITY: Enforce Access Control

### Context Access Control Flow

```
Agent Request for Context:
"Give me customer order history for customer_id=12345"
    ↓
1. AUTHENTICATE
   └─ Who is making this request? (agent identity)
   └─ Result: agent-token with permissions
    ↓
2. AUTHORIZE
   ├─ Does agent have permission to see customer data?
   ├─ Is customer_id in agent's allowed scope?
   └─ Result: ALLOW or DENY (via Policy Card)
    ↓
3. ROW-LEVEL SECURITY
   ├─ Filter orders where user_id = 12345
   ├─ Exclude orders from other customers (auto-filtered)
   └─ Result: Only relevant rows returned
    ↓
4. COLUMN-LEVEL SECURITY
   ├─ Include: order_id, amount, date, status
   ├─ Exclude: credit_card (sensitive)
   ├─ Exclude: internal_cost (confidential)
   └─ Mask: ssn → "***-***-1234"
    ↓
5. LOG & AUDIT
   ├─ Log: agent_id, timestamp, data_accessed, rows_returned
   ├─ Classification: PII accessed (requires audit trail)
   └─ Compliance: 7-year retention for GDPR
    ↓
6. RETURN TO AGENT
   └─ Safe, filtered context ready for LLM
```

### Sensitive Data Patterns

**Automatic detection & masking:**

```yaml
Patterns Detected Automatically:
├─ Credit cards: 16-digit numbers → "****-****-****-1234"
├─ SSN: XXX-XX-#### → "***-**-1234"
├─ Email: user@company.com → "u***@c***.com"
├─ Phone: 1-555-1234 → "1-555-****"
├─ API keys: sk_live_... → "[REDACTED]"
└─ Passwords: any field named "password" → "[REDACTED]"

Custom Rules (organization-specific):
├─ Financial data: Only show to agents in "Finance" domain
├─ Medical: Only show to healthcare agents
├─ Internal IP addresses: Mask from external-facing agents
└─ [Your rules here]
```

---

## CONTEXT FRESHNESS: TTL & Invalidation

### Time-to-Live (TTL) Strategy

```yaml
CONTEXT TYPE → TTL

Customer Profile:
  - If accessed today: 24-hour TTL (unlikely to change)
  - Last accessed: 2026-07-09T10:30Z
  - Expires: 2026-07-10T10:30Z
  └─ Refresh trigger: Account status change event

Inventory / Stock:
  - Real-time data: 5-minute TTL
  - Last accessed: 2026-07-09T16:45:00Z
  - Expires: 2026-07-09T16:50:00Z
  └─ Refresh trigger: Inventory update event (webhook)

Pricing / Exchange Rates:
  - Hourly: 60-minute TTL
  - Daily: 24-hour TTL

FAQs / Policies:
  - Stable: 7-day TTL (rarely change)
  - Last updated: 2026-07-02
  - Expires: 2026-07-09 (refresh on update)
  └─ Refresh trigger: Policy document changed
```

### Smart Invalidation (Event-Driven)

Instead of waiting for TTL, invalidate on events:

```
Data Source (e.g., Customer DB)
    ↓ publishes event
"Customer 12345 status changed: active → suspended"
    ↓
Event Bus (Kafka, Event Hub, Pub/Sub)
    ↓
Cache Invalidation Service
    ├─ Remove: customer_12345 from cache
    ├─ Notify: any agents with cached context for this customer
    └─ Log: context invalidation event
    ↓
Next request: Agent refetches fresh context
```

---

## CONTEXT BUDGET: Cost & Latency Constraints

### Define Context Budgets

```yaml
Customer Service Agent:
  max_input_tokens: 2000       # Context can't exceed this
  max_context_size_kb: 8       # Physical limit (~8KB)
  max_fetch_latency_ms: 200    # Context assembly deadline
  cost_budget_per_query: $0.05 # Max cost for context + inference

  Breakdown:
  ├─ Context tokens: 1000 (~$0.003)
  ├─ Model reasoning: 800 (~$0.006)
  ├─ MCP tool calls: 1-3 (~$0.01)
  └─ TOTAL: ~$0.02 per query (within budget)

Financial Analysis Agent:
  max_input_tokens: 4000       # Can use more context
  max_context_size_kb: 25      # Larger budget for complex analysis
  max_fetch_latency_ms: 500    # OK to wait longer
  cost_budget_per_query: $0.15 # Higher-value queries
```

### Context Budget Violations

**What happens if context exceeds budget?**

```
Agent attempts to load 50KB of customer history

Context Budget: 8KB max
Actual Size: 50KB
Status: OVER BUDGET

Fallback Strategy:
1. Compress: Summarize to 8KB
2. If still over: Prioritize (recent + unresolved only)
3. If still over: Reject expensive context, use defaults
4. Alert: Monitor if this happens repeatedly

Log:
├─ Timestamp: 2026-07-09T16:45:30Z
├─ Agent: customer-service-v2.4
├─ Requested: 50KB
├─ Budget: 8KB
├─ Action: Compressed to 7.2KB
└─ Cost Impact: Saved $0.02 but reduced context quality
```

## CONTEXT DRIFT: When Context Goes Stale

### Detection & Recovery

```yaml
Long-running agent (multi-turn conversation):

Turn 1 (14:00):
  Context: Customer order status = "In Transit"

Turn 5 (14:15): [15 minutes later]
  Agent references: "Your order is in transit"

BUT: Order delivered in the meantime!
  Real status (14:15): "Delivered"

PROBLEM: Context drifted! Agent is misinformed.

SOLUTION:
├─ Detect: Check TTL on context
│  └─ If context older than 5 minutes, refresh
│  
├─ Refresh: Refetch order status
│  └─ New status: "Delivered"
│  
├─ Update: Inject fresh context
│  └─ System: "Updated information: Your order was delivered at 14:05"
│  
└─ Correct: Agent now has accurate information
```

### Refresh Triggers

```yaml
AUTOMATIC (Time-based):
├─ Every N minutes (configurable per data type)
└─ Example: Inventory refreshes every 5 min

EVENT-TRIGGERED (Data-driven):
├─ On order status change
├─ On customer account change
├─ On inventory update
└─ Published as events to Message Queue

MANUAL (User-initiated):
├─ User says: "That's no longer true, check again"
├─ Agent detects contradiction in user feedback
└─ Triggers immediate context refresh
```

---

## CONTEXT ORCHESTRATION: Putting It All Together

### Reference Implementation (Pseudo-code)

```python
class ContextOrchestrator:
    """
    Manages context lifecycle for agents.
    Handles: fetching, compression, security, freshness, budgeting.
    """

    def __init__(self, agent_id, budget_kb=8, ttl_seconds=300):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.budget_kb = budget_kb
        self.ttl_seconds = ttl_seconds
        self.cache = {}

    def assemble_context(self, user_query, user_id):
        """Assemble context for a user query."""

        # Step 1: Determine what context is needed
        required_sources = self.identify_sources(user_query)

        # Step 2: Fetch from each source (with MCP calls)
        context_items = {}

## TODO: Context Engineering for Your Organization

Before deploying agents at scale, decide:

1. **Default Context Strategy**: Eager? Lazy? Hybrid?
2. **Context Budget**: How many KB per request? What's your cost tolerance?
3. **Data Sources**: Which systems will agents access? (DBs, APIs, knowledge bases)
4. **Freshness Requirements**: Which data must be real-time? Which can be cached?
5. **Security Model**: How to enforce row/column-level security?
6. **Compression Rules**: When to summarize? How aggressively?
7. **Monitoring**: How to detect context drift, bloat, or access violations?

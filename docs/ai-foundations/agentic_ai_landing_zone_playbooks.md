## PLAYBOOK 5: Implement Multi-Agent System (6 Weeks)

**Goal:** Deploy your first multi-agent workflow.

### Week 1-2: Design

```
MONDAY: Select workflow
├─ Question: Which business process needs multiple agents?
├─ Examples:
│  ├─ Order processing: Intake → Validation → Fulfillment → Communication
│  ├─ Customer service: Intent → Data gathering → Decision → Response
│  ├─ Compliance: Monitoring → Analysis → Escalation → Remediation
│
└─ DECISION: [Your workflow] ________________

TUESDAY-WEDNESDAY: Select multi-agent pattern
├─ Reference: Multi-Agent Architectures document
├─ Patterns:
│  ├─ Sequential: One agent → next agent → ... (linear)
│  ├─ Supervisor: One coordinator, many specialists (hub)
│  ├─ Hierarchical: CEO → VPs → ICs (org chart)
│  ├─ Mesh: Peer-to-peer agents
│  ├─ Pool: Many identical agents (load-balanced)
│  └─ Swarm: Decentralized agents with local rules
│
├─ Decision tree:
│  ├─ Is workflow linear? → Sequential
│  ├─ One coordinator? → Supervisor
│  ├─ Org hierarchy? → Hierarchical
│  ├─ All agents identical? → Pool
│  └─ Emergent behavior? → Swarm
│
└─ DECISION: [Pattern selected] ________________

THURSDAY-FRIDAY: Design multi-agent architecture
├─ Diagram:
│  ├─ Agents involved (names, roles)
│  ├─ Handoff points (agent A → agent B)
│  ├─ Data contracts (what data passes between)
│  └─ Failure modes (what if agent fails?)
│
├─ Decision interfaces:
│  ├─ How does Agent A know when to call Agent B?
│  ├─ What happens if Agent B fails?
│  ├─ How is final decision made?
│  └─ Who has authority for what?
│
└─ DELIVERABLE: Multi-agent architecture diagram
```

### Week 3-4: Implementation

```
WEEK 3: Build agents & integration
├─ Build each agent (using Playbook 1 template, simplified):
│  ├─ Agent A: [name, logic, tests]
│  ├─ Agent B: [name, logic, tests]
│  └─ Agent N: [name, logic, tests]
│
├─ Integrate: Set up handoff between agents
│  ├─ Agent A completes → passes output to Agent B
│  ├─ Agent B consumes → produces own output
│  └─ Repeat until final output
│
├─ Error handling:
│  ├─ Agent timeout → Skip or escalate?
│  ├─ Agent failure → Retry or failover?
│  └─ Agent produces invalid output → Validation gate?
│
└─ DELIVERABLE: Multi-agent system working in dev

WEEK 4: Testing multi-agent flows
├─ End-to-end tests:
│  ├─ Happy path: Normal flow A → B → C → Output ✓
│  ├─ Error path: B fails → escalate to human ✓
│  ├─ Edge case: A produces unexpected output → C still handles ✓
│  └─ Load: 100 concurrent requests → all complete ✓
│
├─ Latency analysis:
│  ├─ Agent A: ~500ms
│  ├─ Agent B: ~1000ms
│  ├─ Agent C: ~300ms
│  ├─ Total: ~1800ms (within budget?)
│  └─ Optimization: Parallelize if possible
│
└─ DELIVERABLE: All tests passing, performance acceptable
```

### Week 5-6: Deployment

```
WEEK 5: Staging deployment
├─ Deploy to staging environment
├─ Shadow mode: Run parallel to current system
├─ Collect metrics for 24 hours
│
└─ DELIVERABLE: Staging evaluation report (metrics, issues)

WEEK 6: Canary → Production
├─ Canary: 5% traffic, 4 hours
├─ Production: Blue-green deployment to 100%
├─ Monitoring: 24-hour stability check
│
└─ DELIVERABLE: Multi-agent system live in production
```

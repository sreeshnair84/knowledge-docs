## 19. Multi-Agent Delegation Chains — The Hardest Problem

Single-agent 3LO is a solved problem. The harder frontier is **multi-hop delegation**: when an orchestrator agent spawns sub-agents, each of which may call tools or other agents. At each hop, three questions must be answered: (1) whose authority is this acting under? (2) how has scope been constrained at each hop? (3) is there an auditable chain?

### 19.1 The Delegation Chain Problem

OAuth's RFC 8693 was designed for pairwise exchange, not multi-hop agent chains. Three structural limitations emerge in production:

| Limitation | Description | Risk in GENAI Context |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| No cross-domain trust | Each trust domain needs its own auth server. No mechanism for cross-domain token verification without pre-established federation. | Agents calling Atlassian + Graph + GHE in sequence each need separate token exchange — no shared trust fabric. |
| Opaque delegation history | Token exchange produces a new token with no cryptographic record of the original delegation chain. | Audit log cannot prove "Sub-Agent B acted because Orchestrator A was delegated by User X". Chain is asserted, not proven. |
| No holder-side attenuation | Only the auth server can narrow scopes. An intermediary agent cannot further constrain what it delegates. | If Orchestrator receives `write:jira-work`, it can delegate the full scope to Sub-Agent — even if Sub-Agent only needs `read`. |

### 19.2 The `act` Claim — What RFC 8693 Gives You Today

RFC 8693 token exchange supports the `act` claim in the resulting JWT, which carries actor identity. This is the minimum viable audit chain available today:

```json
{
  "sub": "user@org.example",           // The user on whose behalf we act
  "oid": "a3b4c5d6-...",               // User object ID
  "act": {                              // RFC 8693 actor claim
    "sub": "agent-identity-sp-id",     // Which Agent Identity is acting
    "act": {                            // Nested: who delegated to this agent
      "sub": "orchestrator-agent-id"
    }
  },
  "scp": "read:jira-work",             // Scope — MUST be intersection, never union
  "aud": "api.atlassian.com",          // RFC 8707: bound to specific resource
  "exp": 1750000000,
  "iat": 1749996400
}
// The act chain: token is for user, via orchestrator, via agent-identity
// Each hop MUST exchange for a narrower or equal scope — never broader
// Log the full JWT payload (minus sensitive fields) for audit
```

!!! warning "RFC 8693 Attack Vector"
    A compromised intermediary can present a valid `subject_token` and a valid `actor_token` from **different** delegation contexts. The auth server cannot detect this without cryptographic binding. Mitigation: short token TTL + audience binding (RFC 8707) + `correlation_id` logged at every hop.

### 19.3 Practical Multi-Agent Pattern — Scope Attenuation Ladder

Until the IETF OAuth WG formalises cryptographic chain binding, the pragmatic production pattern is the **scope attenuation ladder**:

| Hop | Actor | Token Received | Exchange To | Scope Rule |
|-----|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| 0 — User | Human user signs in | User token Tc (full delegated scope) | Passes Tc to Orchestrator | User's full consent scope |
| 1 — Orchestrator | Orchestrator Agent Identity | Receives Tc; exchanges via OBO to T_orch | Passes T_orch to Sub-Agent or Tool | Request ONLY what current task needs — not full Tc scope |
| 2 — Sub-Agent | Sub-Agent Agent Identity | Receives T_orch; exchanges via OBO to T_sub | Passes T_sub to Tool/API | Further narrow: only scope for this specific tool call |
| 3 — Tool/API | Resource server (Jira, Graph) | Receives T_sub; validates audience + scope | Executes API call | User permissions always constrain regardless of scope on token |

!!! warning "Mandatory Rule"
    Scope attenuation is a MUST at each hop. Never pass an orchestrator's full scope to a sub-agent. Each exchange should request only what is needed for the immediate task. This is the primary defence against excessive agency in multi-agent pipelines.

### 19.4 Correlation & Audit Across Agent Hops

```python
# Every agent call must carry and propagate correlation metadata
# In HTTP headers (add to all inter-agent calls):
X-Correlation-ID: {uuid4}             # Generated at user request entry; propagated unchanged
X-Agent-Chain: orchestrator-v2,sub-agent-jira-v1   # Append each agent name
X-Delegation-Depth: 2                  # Hop count (enforce max depth = 3 in gateway policy)
X-User-OID: a3b4c5d6-...              # Original user OID — never allow agent to override

# Audit log entry at each hop (structured JSON):
{
  "correlation_id": "cf3a...",
  "agent_id": "sub-agent-jira-v1",
  "user_oid": "a3b4c5d6-...",
  "delegated_by": "orchestrator-v2",
  "action": "PATCH",
  "resource": "jira/DEMO-123/status",
  "scope_used": "write:jira-work",
  "hop_depth": 2,
  "token_exp": 1749999600,
  "timestamp": "2026-06-28T10:15:00Z",
  "result": 200
}
# This enables the CISO query: 'Show everything agent-chain X did on behalf of user Y'
# Also required for DORA ICT incident reporting
```

### 19.5 Maximum Delegation Depth Policy

| Policy | Recommended Value | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Max delegation depth | 3 hops (user → orchestrator → sub-agent → tool) | Beyond 3, audit chain is practically unverifiable; attack surface grows exponentially |
| Min scope at each hop | Only the scope required for the immediate tool call | Principle of least privilege; prevents sub-agents inheriting orchestrator's full authority |
| Token TTL reduction | Each hop halves the remaining TTL | Limits blast radius if a mid-chain token is compromised; ensures chain expires |
| Max concurrent chains | Policy-defined per agent blueprint | Prevent agent spawning unbounded sub-agent trees; enforce in AC Gateway |
| Correlation ID required | Mandatory — reject calls without it | Without it, audit reconstruction across hops is impossible |

## 20. The 2026 Agent Protocol Stack: MCP + A2A + Streamable HTTP

The ecosystem has converged on a three-layer protocol stack for production agent systems:

| Layer | Protocol | Governs | Auth Mechanism | Status (June 2026) |
|-------|---------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Tool access | MCP (Model Context Protocol) | How agent calls tools, reads data, invokes prompts | OAuth 2.1 + PKCE mandatory for remote HTTP servers; Dynamic Client Registration | Production; 2025-11-05 spec; mandated by ChatGPT (Sept 2025), Claude, Copilot |
| Agent coordination | A2A (Agent-to-Agent) | How agents delegate tasks to other agents; capability discovery via Agent Cards | RFC 8693 token exchange; OAuth 2.0 M2M per agent identity | v1.0 released April 2026; 150+ orgs including AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP |
| Transport | Streamable HTTP (MCP 2025-03-26 spec) | Bidirectional streaming between agent and tool server | Bearer token in Authorization header; token bound to session via RFC 8707 | Replaced SSE as primary MCP transport; production in all major frameworks |
| Identity layer | IETF drafts: AIMS, WIMSE, Agentic JWT, SCIM for agents | Cryptographic agent identity, cross-domain trust, agent lifecycle | Emerging: AIP proposes Invocation-Bound Capability Tokens | Draft stage; no single standard adopted yet |

### 20.1 How MCP Auth Works (2025-11-05 Spec)

The MCP specification mandates OAuth 2.1 for all remote (HTTP) MCP servers:

| Step | Actor | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | MCP Client (Agent) | Contacts MCP server without auth |
| 2 | MCP Server | Returns 401 + Protected Resource Metadata (RFC 9728) pointing to authorisation server |
| 3 | MCP Client | Fetches auth server metadata; performs Dynamic Client Registration if needed |
| 4 | MCP Client | Runs OAuth 2.1 Auth Code + PKCE (for user-delegated) or Client Credentials (for M2M) |
| 5 | Auth Server (Entra ID) | Issues access token bound to MCP server audience (RFC 8707 resource indicator) |
| 6 | MCP Client | Includes Bearer token in all subsequent calls to MCP server |
| 7 | MCP Server | Validates token: signature, expiry, audience == this server's URI |

!!! note "MCP 2025-11-05 Additions"
    Mandatory PKCE for all clients, Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) as preferred registration method, step-up authorisation for incremental scope consent. All compatible with the 3LO pattern in this document.

### 20.2 How A2A Auth Works (v1.0)

A2A uses Agent Cards (JSON-LD documents) for capability discovery and OAuth M2M tokens for per-agent authentication:

```json
// Agent Card (published by Sub-Agent at /.well-known/agent.json)
{
  "name": "JiraSubAgent",
  "version": "1.2",
  "url": "https://jira-agent.genai.org.internal/a2a",
  "capabilities": ["jira:read", "jira:write"],
  "authentication": {
    "type": "oauth2",
    "tokenEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tid}/oauth2/v2.0/token",
    "scopes": ["api://jira-sub-agent/.default"]
  },
  "identity": {
    "entraAgentIdentityId": "sub-agent-sp-object-id"
  }
}
```

```http
// Orchestrator calls Sub-Agent via A2A
POST https://jira-agent.genai.org.internal/a2a/tasks
Authorization: Bearer {T_sub_from_RFC8693_exchange}
X-Correlation-ID: {parent_correlation_id}
X-Delegation-Depth: 2

{
  "taskId": "task-uuid",
  "input": {"action": "update_status", "issue": "DEMO-123", "status": "Done"},
  "context": {"user_oid": "a3b4c5d6", "delegated_by": "orchestrator-v2"}
}
```

### 20.3 Protocol Choice Matrix for GENAI Agent Foundry

| Scenario | Protocol | Auth Pattern | AC Gateway Role |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Agent calls Jira/Confluence REST API | Direct HTTPS (no MCP/A2A) | 3LO: per-user `refresh_token` in vault → `access_token` injected at gateway | Credential vault lookup + injection + audit log |
| Agent calls internal MCP tool server (e.g., Jira MCP) | MCP (Streamable HTTP) | OAuth 2.1 Bearer token; gateway proxies and re-signs with agent identity | Token validation inbound + outbound MCP auth header injection |
| Orchestrator delegates to Jira sub-agent | A2A v1.0 | RFC 8693 OBO exchange; scope attenuated at each hop; `act` chain in JWT | Enforce max delegation depth; validate `act` chain; propagate `correlation_id` |
| Agent acts autonomously (no user context, org-level task) | Direct HTTPS or MCP | 2LO: Client Credentials via Blueprint → Agent Identity `fmi_path` chain | App credential vault; no per-user token needed; audit with `agent_id` only |
| Agent triggers high-risk action across any protocol | CIBA (overlaid on any transport) | Suspend action; send backchannel approval request to user; resume on approve | CIBA decision endpoint; approval state machine; timeout/rejection handling |

---

## 21. Regulatory Compliance: DORA, NIS2 & EU AI Act

AI agents that access ICT systems are within scope of DORA and NIS2. The 3LO + AC Gateway architecture directly satisfies several mandatory obligations.

### 21.1 DORA — Digital Operational Resilience Act (Reg. EU 2022/2554)

DORA became fully applicable 17 January 2025. In 2026, regulators have moved from reviewing paperwork to demanding real-time proof of control.

| DORA Pillar | Specific Requirement | How This Architecture Addresses It |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1. ICT Risk Management | Art. 6-10: Identify, protect, detect, respond, recover. Log all ICT operations. | Every agent API call logged with `agent_id`, `user_oid`, scope, resource, result, timestamp. Entra Identity Protection detects anomalous token usage. |
| 2. ICT Incident Reporting | Art. 17-19: Classify, report to NCA within 24h (early warning), 72h (full report). | P0 incident playbook (Vol. 2 §15) maps to DORA classification. Correlation IDs allow reconstructing full impact scope for regulators. |
| 3. Digital Operational Resilience Testing | Art. 24-27: Annual TLPT for significant institutions. | Token vault, AC Gateway, and Entra Agent ID are in-scope ICT systems for TLPT. Include 3LO token theft scenarios, delegation chain splicing, and prompt injection in test plans. |
| 4. ICT Third-Party Risk | Art. 28-44: Register all ICT third-party providers. Assess concentration risk. | Entra ID (Microsoft), GitHub Enterprise, Atlassian, AWS are all ICT third parties. Must be in the Register of Information. Microsoft is a designated CTPP under DORA — EU oversight applies directly. |
| 5. Information Sharing | Art. 45: Voluntary sharing of cyber threat intelligence. | Agent token abuse patterns (unusual scope requests, unexpected countries, after-hours activity) are shareable threat indicators. |

### 21.2 NIS2 — Network and Information Security Directive

Banks are 'essential entities' under NIS2 Annex I Sector 4. DORA is lex specialis for ICT risk management, but NIS2 still applies for CSIRT reporting and supply chain security.

| NIS2 Article | Requirement | Architectural Control |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Art. 21 — Security measures | Access control, least privilege, MFA, encryption, audit logging | 3LO per-user scoped tokens (not shared accounts). FIC+MSI (no passwords). AES-256-GCM vault encryption. Full audit log. Conditional Access enforced at blueprint level. |
| Art. 21 — Supply chain security | Assess security of ICT suppliers and their practices | Atlassian, GitHub, Microsoft are ICT suppliers for agent-accessed data. Their 3LO implementations must be assessed: PKCE enforced? Refresh token rotation? Scope granularity? |
| Art. 22 — Incident reporting | Early warning within 24h of significant incident to national CSIRT | P0 playbook (§15.2) includes CSIRT notification step. Significant incident = agent accessing data it was not authorised to access, or credential vault breach. |
| Art. 21 — Continuity | Business continuity plans covering ICT systems | Token vault fallback: if vault unavailable, agents must gracefully degrade (not silently fail open). Circuit breaker: if Entra unavailable, agent queues tasks rather than proceeding without auth. |

### 21.3 EU AI Act — High-Risk System Considerations

The EU AI Act (applicable August 2026 for high-risk systems) intersects with DORA via Article 9(10). Agents that access user data and make decisions affecting customers may be classified as high-risk.

| EU AI Act Obligation | Applicability | Control Mapping |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Human oversight (Art. 14) | High-risk: agent makes decisions affecting users (credit, fraud, customer service actions) | CIBA gate for irreversible actions. Access Reviews for agent permissions. Human escalation path in agent workflow design. |
| Technical documentation (Art. 11) | High-risk: full lifecycle documentation required | Volume 1-4 document series. Architecture Decision Records. |
| Logging & audit (Art. 12) | High-risk: logs must enable post-hoc reconstruction of AI decisions | Full delegation chain log (§19.4). User OID + `agent_id` + scope + resource + timestamp on every call. |
| Data governance (Art. 10) | Training data and input data quality | Scoped tokens limit what data agent can read. `read:jira-work` scope prevents agent from accessing financial core systems via the same identity. |
| Conformity assessment (Art. 43) | Third-party assessment for high-risk systems | Entra Agent ID, AC Gateway, and credential vault are in-scope for conformity assessment if agent system is classified high-risk. |

!!! warning "Practical Advice"
    If agents are used for customer-facing decisions (fraud flagging, service actions), classify as high-risk early and design to EU AI Act Art. 14 (human oversight) from the start. Retrofitting human oversight into a production agent is significantly harder than designing it in.

---

## 22. Agent Identity Governance Model — Three Lines of Defence

DORA explicitly requires three independent lines of defence for ICT risk:

| Line | Role | Responsibilities for Agent Identity | Tools |
|------|------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| Line 1 — Agent Owner / Builder | Business unit / team that builds and operates the agent | Define minimal scope set. Register OAuth apps with least-privilege scopes. Implement sidecar pattern. Configure CIBA gates for high-risk tools. Ensure `offline_access` only requested when background operation is needed. | Entra Agent ID portal, AC Gateway config, Atlassian/GHE dev console |
| Line 2 — Security / Identity Team | Independent risk function | Review all new agent identity registrations. Define consent flow standards. Set Conditional Access policies on blueprints. Monitor Entra Identity Protection alerts for agent identities. Perform quarterly access reviews. | Entra admin centre, Identity Protection, Access Reviews, Security SIEM |
| Line 3 — Internal Audit | Independent assurance | Annual audit: verify Line 1 controls work. Verify Line 2 independence. Sample audit log entries: confirm `agent_id` + `user_oid` + scope present on all entries. DORA TLPT coordination: confirm agents are in-scope for penetration testing. | Audit sampling tools, log analytics, TLPT coordination |

### 22.1 Agent Registry — Mandatory for Governance at Scale

Every deployed agent identity must be registered with the following mandatory fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `agent_id` | UUID (Entra Agent Identity SP object ID) | Primary key; used in all audit logs |
| `blueprint_id` | UUID (Entra Blueprint app registration ID) | Links instance to its policy template |
| `agent_name` | String | Human-readable; appears in consent screens and audit UIs |
| `owning_team` | Team/org identifier | Line 1 accountability; notified on Access Review |
| `security_sponsor` | Entra user UPN | Line 2 accountability; approves scope changes; DORA: designated responsible person |
| `provider_connections` | Enum[] | Which providers this agent can access: `atlassian`, `graph`, `ghe`, ... |
| `scopes_granted` | String[] | Explicit list of all delegated scopes; reviewed quarterly |
| `consent_model` | Enum | `admin_pre_consent` \| `user_3lo` \| `ciba_required` |
| `risk_tier` | Enum | `read_only` \| `standard` \| `high_risk` \| `critical` (triggers CIBA requirement) |
| `registered_at` | Timestamp | Creation date; dormant agents flagged after 90 days without use |
| `last_active` | Timestamp | Updated by vault on every credential access; drives dormancy detection |
| `dora_in_scope` | Boolean | Whether this agent is in scope for DORA incident reporting and TLPT |

### 22.2 Access Review Schedule

| Review Type | Frequency | Who Performs | Output |
|------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Quarterly scope review | Every 90 days | Security sponsor + owning team | Confirm each scope still needed; remove unused scopes; escalate if dormant |
| Annual full review | Yearly | Security team + Internal Audit | Full agent identity inventory; decommission unused; DORA evidence |
| Event-triggered review | On incident / personnel change | Security team | Immediate review of all agent identities owned by departing person; transfer or revoke |
| Pre-deployment review | Before every new agent goes live | Security team (Line 2 sign-off) | Scope approval; consent model approval; risk tier assignment; DORA scoping decision |

---

## 23. Forward-Looking: The 2027 Protocol Horizon

### 23.1 Emerging IETF Standards (2026 Drafts)

| Draft | What It Defines | Relevance | Likely Timeline |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| `draft-oauth-ai-agents-on-behalf-of-user` (-02, Aug 2025) | Extends Auth Code flow: `requested_actor` param names the agent on consent screen; `actor_token` authenticates agent at token endpoint | Directly relevant: users will see agent name on Atlassian/Graph consent screens. | Expected OAuth WG adoption 2026-2027 |
| `draft-mw-spice-actor-chain` | Cryptographically verifiable actor chains for OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange | Solves delegation chain splicing (§19.2). When ratified, replace `correlation_id` approach with cryptographic binding. | Draft stage; experimental implementations 2026 |
| `draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining` | OAuth identity and authorisation chaining across trust domains | Solves cross-domain agent calls. Relevant if GENAI agents need to federate across partner organisations. | Active WG discussion; 2027 target |
| WIMSE (Workload Identity in Multi-Service Environments) | Cross-service workload identity standard; agent as a workload identity type | Standardises how agent identity is asserted across cloud boundaries without cloud-provider-specific FIC mechanisms. | Draft 2026; production 2027 |
| SCIM for AI Agents (IETF 2026) | Agent lifecycle management: provisioning, deprovisioning, attribute management via SCIM | Will standardise the Agent Registry schema and automate agent deprovisioning via standard SCIM DELETE calls to Entra. | Early draft; watch for adoption |
| AIP: Agent Identity Protocol (arxiv 2603.24775) | Invocation-Bound Capability Tokens (IBCTs) — offline attenuable delegation with cryptographic provenance | Academic proposal addressing all 7 agent identity requirements that OAuth alone cannot satisfy. Not yet an IETF draft. | Research 2026; potential standardisation 2027+ |

### 23.2 Platform Roadmap Watch

| Platform | Expected Development | Impact on This Architecture |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Microsoft Entra Agent ID | Agent 365 admin centre (M365 admin view for all agents). GA of beta Graph APIs (`agentIdentities`). SCIM provisioning for agent identities. | Simplifies agent registry — Agent 365 may replace bespoke registry. GA APIs remove beta risk. |
| Atlassian | Admin-level revocation for 3LO grants (currently only per-user or app uninstall). Richer MCP server for Jira/Confluence. | Solves OQ-3 (admin cannot revoke per-user grant). MCP server removes need for direct REST token management. |
| GitHub Enterprise | Fine-grained PATs reaching enterprise admin controls. GitHub App improvements for org-level agent access. | Reduces reliance on OAuth App long-lived tokens. Fine-grained PATs solve the GHE refresh token gap. |
| MCP + A2A joint spec (Q3 2026 target) | AAIF-governed joint specification bridging MCP tool calls and A2A agent coordination at auth layer | Will likely define a unified token format for tool-call + agent-delegation. |

## 24. Agent Auth Maturity Model — Where Are You Now?

| Level | Name | Characteristics | Target for GENAI Foundry |
|-------|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 0 — Unsafe | Credential in agent | Static API keys or service account tokens embedded in agent code or env vars. No per-user isolation. No audit trail. Global blast radius. | NOT acceptable. Zero tolerance policy. |
| 1 — Authenticated | Agent has identity | Agent has its own Entra service principal. Uses client credentials (2LO). Tokens not in code — in Key Vault or env. Centralised logging. | Minimum for autonomous (non-user-data) agents |
| 2 — Delegated | User-delegated access (3LO) | 3LO consent flow implemented. Per-user `refresh_tokens` in encrypted vault. Proactive refresh. Rotating tokens. User can revoke. Scope minimised. | **Target for MD-1, MD-2, MD-3 (Minimal Delivery)** |
| 3 — Governed | Auditable + policy-enforced | FIC+MSI credential (no secrets). AC Gateway as PEP. OPA policy on every tool call. CIBA for high-risk actions. Full `act` chain in audit log. Access Reviews quarterly. Agent Registry. Three lines of defence operating. | **Target for Phase 2-3 production readiness** |
| 4 — Resilient | DORA/NIS2 compliant + tested | All Level 3 controls + DORA TLPT in scope for agents. CTPP concentration risk assessed. Automated incident reporting pipeline. EU AI Act conformity assessed. Chaos engineering: token vault outage → graceful degradation, not fail-open. | Target for Phase 3 + regulatory audit readiness |
| 5 — Adaptive | Cryptographically provable + federated | Invocation-Bound Capability Tokens (or equivalent). Cryptographic `act` chain. Cross-domain trust without pre-established federation. Automated SCIM lifecycle. Real-time risk-adaptive token issuance. | 2027+ horizon; watch IETF drafts |

## Series Executive Summary — Volumes 1, 2 & 3

The problem is real and urgent. AI agents acting on behalf of users across M365, Atlassian, and GHE need user-delegated auth that is auditable, least-privilege, and compliant with DORA. 93% of production agent projects use unscoped API keys. 79% of organisations have deployed agents; only 14% have full security approval. The gap is the opportunity this spec addresses.

The solution is standardised and production-proven. The EntraID 3LO pattern — Blueprint → FIC/MSI → Agent Identity → OBO token exchange → per-user scoped access — is in production at Microsoft, AWS, Auth0, TrueFoundry, and Atlassian. No new primitives are needed. What is needed is disciplined implementation.

**The three non-negotiables remain:**

1. **No client secrets** — FIC+MSI
2. **Per-user token isolation** with encrypted vault and proactive refresh
3. **Full audit trail**: `agent_id` + `user_oid` + scope + resource + timestamp on every call

Everything else — CIBA, multi-agent chains, MCP/A2A, DORA compliance — builds on these three.

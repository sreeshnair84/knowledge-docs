## Key Standards Reference

### OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 2.1

| **Standard** | **RFC / Spec** | **Key Requirements** | **AI Agent Relevance** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth 2.0 Core | RFC 6749 | Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Implicit, ROPC grants | Foundation for all AI tool authentication |
| OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens | RFC 6750 | Bearer token usage in Authorization header | Every AI API call uses bearer tokens |
| OAuth 2.1 (draft) | draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1 | PKCE mandatory; Implicit + ROPC prohibited; exact redirect URI | New AI integrations should target 2.1 |
| PKCE | RFC 7636 | `code_verifier`, `code_challenge`, S256 method | Required for all public clients (AI IDEs, CLIs) |
| Token Introspection | RFC 7662 | `POST /introspect` to validate opaque token | MCP servers validate user tokens at runtime |
| Token Revocation | RFC 7009 | `POST /revoke` to invalidate tokens | Used on user offboarding, session termination |
| Dynamic Client Registration | RFC 7591 | Programmatic OAuth client registration | Agent-to-agent trust establishment |

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)

| **Specification** | **Purpose** | **Key Claims** | **AI Agent Use** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OIDC Core 1.0 | ID token format and validation | `sub`, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nonce` | User identity in ID token; passed to MCP servers |
| OIDC Discovery | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` | Authorization, token, JWKS endpoints | AI platform discovers IdP endpoints automatically |
| OIDC Dynamic Registration | Client registration at IdP | Client metadata, redirect URIs | AI agent self-registers with enterprise IdP |
| OIDC Session Management | Front-channel and back-channel logout | Session state, logout endpoints | AI platform terminates session on IdP logout |
| OIDC FAPI 2.0 | Financial-grade API profile | Strengthened OIDC for banking | Banking AI must comply with FAPI 2.0 |

### RFC 8693 — OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange

RFC 8693 defines the `token-exchange` grant type, enabling a service to obtain a new token on behalf of another entity. This is the foundation for all On-Behalf-Of patterns in enterprise AI.

**RFC 8693 Token Exchange Request Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Value / Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `grant_type` | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` |
| `subject_token` | The incoming token (user's access token to exchange) |
| `subject_token_type` | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token` |
| `requested_token_type` | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token` (or `jwt`) |
| `audience` | Target service identifier (e.g. `https://graph.microsoft.com`) |
| `scope` | Requested scopes for the new token |
| `actor_token` | Optional: token representing the acting service (AI platform) |
| `actor_token_type` | Optional: type of actor token |

### RFC 7523 — JWT Bearer Token for OAuth 2.0

RFC 7523 defines how a JWT can be used as an OAuth 2.0 grant type ('JWT Bearer') or client authentication mechanism. This enables service-to-service authentication without client secrets, using signed JWTs with short expiry instead.

**RFC 7523 JWT Bearer Use Cases**

| **Use Case** | **JWT Bearer Application** |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub App authentication | GitHub App signs JWT with private key; exchanges for installation token |
| Salesforce JWT Bearer flow | App presents user-asserting JWT; Salesforce issues user access token |
| Service account assertion | AI service signs JWT claiming service identity; IdP issues access token |
| OBO pre-authorization | Admin pre-authorizes users; app presents JWT asserting user identity |

### Downscoping and Scope Reduction

Downscoping is the practice of obtaining a token with reduced scopes from a broader token. This enables least-privilege tool execution: the AI platform holds a broad user token but requests narrow-scope tokens for each individual tool call.

**Downscoping Patterns**

| **Pattern** | **Mechanism** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google Credential Downscoping | `google-auth` `DownscopedCredentials` class | Broad storage token → read-only token for specific GCS bucket |
| Entra OBO with limited scope | `scope` parameter in OBO request | Full Graph token → `Files.Read.All` only for SharePoint calls |
| AWS STS AssumeRole with policy | Inline session policy in `AssumeRole` | Admin role → read-only S3 session for specific prefix |
| Kafka / OAuth scope reduction | `scope` parameter in token exchange | Broad Kafka admin → specific topic read scope |

## Decision Frameworks

### Choosing an Authentication Method for a New Connector

Use this decision framework when adding a new tool connector to an enterprise AI platform:

| **Question** | **If YES →** | **If NO →** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Does the target API support OAuth 2.0? | Use OAuth 2.0 (proceed to next question) | Consider SAML Bearer, API key, or PAT (with strict rotation) |
| Do you need user identity in the API call? | Use OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE (user-delegated) | Use Client Credentials (service account); document that user identity is lost |
| Is this a public client (CLI, browser, IDE)? | PKCE is MANDATORY; do not use client secret | Confidential client: use client secret + PKCE |
| Does the target support OBO / token exchange? | Use RFC 8693 token exchange for multi-hop identity | Each hop needs separate OAuth consent; educate users |
| Is the token lifetime > 2 hours? | Request `offline_access` for refresh token; implement silent refresh | Implement re-auth prompt before token expiry |
| Is this a high-privilege API (write/delete)? | Require human approval gate before execution | Proceed with standard OAuth flow |
| Is this API in a regulated scope (PCI, SOX)? | Add OPA policy; require additional approvals; extra audit logging | Standard governance controls apply |

### Choosing Between Service Account and Delegated Access

| **Factor** | **Use Delegated (User Token)** | **Use Service Account** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger | User actively requests the action | Background task, scheduled job, indexing |
| Audit requirement | Must know which user did the action | System action; no specific user context needed |
| Permission level | User's own permissions (least privilege) | Admin-granted narrow permissions |
| Data access scope | User can only see what they can access | Must be explicitly restricted; risk of over-access |
| Compliance | Required for PCI, SOX user attribution | Acceptable for non-user-attributed background work |
| Revocation | Token revoked when user leaves | Service account managed independently |

## Implementation Checklists

### OAuth 2.1 — Authorization Server

- [ ] Enforce PKCE (S256 method) for all clients
- [ ] Prohibit implicit grant type
- [ ] Prohibit Resource Owner Password Credentials grant
- [ ] Enforce exact redirect URI matching
- [ ] Implement refresh token rotation on each use
- [ ] Support RFC 8693 token exchange for OBO
- [ ] Publish `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- [ ] Rotate signing keys; publish JWKS at `/.well-known/jwks.json`

### OAuth 2.1 — Client (AI Platform)

- [ ] Generate unique `code_verifier` (min 43 chars, base64url encoded)
- [ ] Compute `code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA256(code_verifier))`
- [ ] Store `code_verifier` only in server memory (not in browser)
- [ ] Validate `state` parameter to prevent CSRF
- [ ] Validate `id_token`: signature, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nonce`
- [ ] Store tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256 + KMS)
- [ ] Never log access tokens or refresh tokens
- [ ] Implement silent refresh before token expiry (at 75% lifetime)

### OAuth 2.1 — Resource Server (MCP Server / API)

- [ ] Validate token: signature, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `scope`
- [ ] Check token against revocation list (JTI blacklist or introspection)
- [ ] Support Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) claims
- [ ] Log all API calls with token JTI + user `sub` + correlation IDs
- [ ] Return `WWW-Authenticate` header on 401 with proper error codes
- [ ] Never reflect token back in error responses or logs

### MCP Server Security Checklist

- [ ] Register MCP server in approved server registry; sign manifest
- [ ] Validate caller identity (AI platform JWT) before processing any tool call
- [ ] Validate user identity token (OAuth) before executing tool
- [ ] Check OPA policy before and after tool execution
- [ ] Log every tool invocation with: `tool_name`, `user_id`, `args_hash`, `trace_id`
- [ ] Implement rate limiting per user per tool (e.g. 100 calls/min)
- [ ] Reject tool calls with unexpected or malformed parameter schemas
- [ ] Sanitize tool output before returning to AI (prevent prompt injection via results)
- [ ] Use short-lived credentials for downstream API calls (not long-lived service account keys)
- [ ] Implement health checks; alert on anomalous tool call patterns

### Audit & Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Define and document the 10-step audit chain (login → API call → response)
- [ ] Implement `trace_id` (W3C `traceparent`) propagation through all components
- [ ] Ensure `conversation_id` is included in all tool call logs
- [ ] Centralise logs in SIEM (Splunk / Azure Sentinel / Chronicle)
- [ ] Implement non-repudiable log storage (WORM or cryptographic chaining)
- [ ] Define log retention periods per regulation (PCI: 12 months; SOX: 7 years)
- [ ] Create SIEM detection rules for AI-specific threats (token exfil, prompt injection)
- [ ] Schedule quarterly access reviews for AI service accounts and OAuth apps
- [ ] Document AI audit trail in compliance evidence package
- [ ] Test end-to-end audit trail annually (trace a sample interaction from user to API)

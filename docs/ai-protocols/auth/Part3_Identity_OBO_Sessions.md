# Enterprise Authentication & Identity Propagation for AI Agents — Confidential Research

Enterprise AI Authentication Research  Part
Part 3
Identity Propagation, OBO & Session
Management
How user identity flows through AI platforms, On-Behalf-Of patterns,
long-running sessions, and multi-tool agent orchestration
Enterprise Authentication & Identity Propagation for AI Agents

Part 3A — User Authentication
The foundational question in enterprise AI security is: when an AI agent takes an action, whose identity is
presented to the downstream system? This section traces the authentication journey from user login
through to the final API call, answering key questions about SSO reuse, session storage, token
management, and credential security.
End-to-End Identity Flow
User logs in to enterprise IdP (Entra ID, Okta, Ping, Google) via SSO
↓
IdP issues SAML assertion or OIDC ID token + access token for AI platform
↓
AI platform validates token; establishes authenticated session for user
↓
User interacts with AI; AI decides to call a tool (e.g. GitHub, ServiceNow)
↓
AI runtime retrieves user's OAuth token for that tool (or performs OBO exchange)
↓
Tool API is called with user's token; API enforces user's own permissions
↓
Response returned; all steps logged with common correlation ID
Key Authentication Questions Answered
Authentication Questions — Detailed Answers
Question
Standard Answer
Notes
Is the user authenticated only once?
Yes (SSO + token caching)
User logs in once to IdP; AI platform
and tools use issued tokens
Is SSO reused?
Yes
SAML/OIDC session at IdP enables
silent re-authentication without
password
Is OAuth performed every session?
No (cached tokens + refresh)
First-time consent grants refresh
token; subsequent sessions use silent
refresh

Question
Standard Answer
Notes
Are refresh tokens stored?
Yes (server-side, encrypted)
Stored in AI platform backend; never
sent to browser in production systems
Is browser session reused?
Yes (HttpOnly cookies)
Browser holds session cookie;
backend validates and associates
with user context
Is PKCE used?
Yes (best practice)
Prevents authorization code
interception; required for public clients
Is OAuth Device Flow used?
For CLI/headless agents
GitHub Copilot CLI, AWS CLI use
Device Flow; not for web-based AI
Does the connector maintain cookies?
No (token-based)
Modern connectors use bearer
tokens; cookies only for web session
layer
Is session stored server-side?
Yes (primary storage)
Server-side session for security;
browser holds only opaque session ID
Is session stored client-side?
Partially (MSAL cache)
MSAL.js caches tokens in
sessionStorage/localStorage;
encrypted in production
Are access tokens encrypted?
Yes (in transit and at rest)
TLS in transit; AES-256 or KMS at
rest; HSM for high-security
deployments
Where are refresh tokens stored?
Server-side encrypted store
Database with encryption; separate
from application secrets; rotated
regularly
How are secrets rotated?
Automated (OAuth rotation)
Refresh token rotation on each use;
access tokens expire and are
reissued

Part 3B — Identity Propagation
Identity propagation is the process of carrying the user's verified identity from the AI platform through to
every downstream API call. The goal is that each system the AI interacts with sees the user's identity —
not the AI platform's service account — so that permissions are correctly enforced and audit logs reflect
the actual actor.
What GitHub Sees When an AI Calls Its API
GitHub — What Identity Does the API See?
Scenario
What GitHub API Sees
Identity in Audit Log
Recommended?
AI uses user's OAuth token
(delegated)
User's GitHub identity
(login, ID)
User login (e.g. john.doe)
YES — full user identity
propagation
AI uses GitHub App
installation token
App identity + installation
context
App name (e.g.
my-ai-agent[bot])
Acceptable for org-level
tasks; no individual user
context
AI uses service account
PAT
Service account identity
Service account login (e.g.
ai-bot)
AVOID for user-driven
actions — masks real actor
AI uses OBO-exchanged
token
User's GitHub identity
User login (e.g. john.doe)
YES if GitHub is
OIDC-connected to
enterprise IdP
Best Practice: For any AI action that creates, modifies, or deletes content in GitHub (commits, PRs,
issues, comments), the API call should use the user's own GitHub OAuth token or a user-to-server GitHub
App token. Using a shared service account or bot token breaks the audit chain and makes it impossible to
attribute changes to individual employees.

Part 3C — On-Behalf-Of (OBO) Deep Dive
The OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow (RFC 8693) enables a middle-tier service (like an AI platform) to
exchange an incoming user token for a new token scoped to a downstream service — while preserving the
user's identity throughout. This is the gold standard for enterprise AI multi-service identity propagation.
Microsoft Graph OBO Implementation
Microsoft Entra OBO Flow (RFC 8693)
User authenticates to Entra ID; receives access token for AI platform (audience: AI app)
↓
User sends request to AI platform with access token
↓
AI platform validates incoming token; extracts user identity (sub, upn, oid)
↓
AI platform sends OBO request to Entra ID /token endpoint:
↓
grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
↓
requested_token_use=on_behalf_of
↓
assertion=
↓
scope=<https://graph.microsoft.com/Files.ReadWrite>
↓
Entra ID validates that AI platform app has 'Act on behalf of user' (Scp claim)
↓
Entra ID issues new access token for Microsoft Graph, still bearing user's identity
↓
AI platform calls Graph API using the new token — Graph sees user's identity
↓

SharePoint, Exchange, Teams enforce user's actual permissions — no elevation possible

RFC 8693 Token Exchange — Key Request Parameters
The following parameters are sent to the IdP token endpoint:
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
&subject;_token=
&subject;_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
&requested;_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
&audience;=
&scope;=
&actor;_token=
&actor;_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
ServiceNow Delegated Execution
ServiceNow supports two primary models for AI agent delegated execution:
 OAuth Impersonation: An OAuth token is issued with the user's identity via a JWT Bearer assertion.
The ServiceNow platform sees API calls as coming from the named user.
 Scripted Delegation: A Flow Designer flow runs under a service account but logs the original
requester's identity using gs.getUser() and stored in the work_notes or audit fields.

ServiceNow OBO Pattern Recommendation
 Use OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow to obtain user tokens for interactive AI actions
 Pass the user's sys_user ID in all Flow context variables for audit purposes
 Implement approval workflows (Human-in-the-Loop) for privileged ServiceNow actions
 Log both the acting OAuth user and the originating AI conversation ID in sys_audit

Part 3D — Long-Running Sessions
Enterprise AI conversations may span hours or days — well beyond the lifetime of a typical OAuth access
token (60-120 minutes). Production systems must handle token expiry transparently while maintaining
security boundaries and respecting session revocation policies.

Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)
CAE is a protocol extension that allows resource servers (e.g. Microsoft Graph, SharePoint) to reject
access tokens in near-real-time based on events, even before the token would normally expire.
CAE-enabled tokens can have lifetimes of up to 24 hours while remaining revocable within seconds of a
policy change.
Events That Trigger CAE Token Revocation
 User password change or reset
 User account disabled or deleted
 Administrator explicitly revokes all refresh tokens (via Entra ID)
 User's location changes and violates Conditional Access policy
 High-risk sign-in detected by Entra ID Identity Protection
 Session revocation via Microsoft Entra admin portal

Part 3E — Multi-Tool Agent Orchestration
A common enterprise AI workflow involves an agent reading from multiple systems in a single
conversational turn — for example, reading a GitHub PR, a linked Jira story, a Confluence design page,
then updating ServiceNow and posting a Slack summary. This requires five separate OAuth sessions to be
managed simultaneously.
Five-Tool Agent Execution Flow
User: 'Summarise PR #142, the Jira story it links to, the design doc, update the SN ticket, and
post to #eng'
↓
AI Orchestrator: resolves intent → 5 tool calls required
↓
Tool 1 — GitHub: retrieve user's GitHub OAuth token → GET /repos/.../pulls/142
↓
Tool 2 — Jira: retrieve user's Jira OAuth token → GET /rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-99
↓
Tool 3 — Confluence: retrieve user's Confluence token → GET /wiki/rest/api/content/...
↓
Tool 4 — ServiceNow: retrieve user's SN OAuth token → PATCH /api/now/table/incident/...
↓
Tool 5 — Slack: retrieve user's Slack token → POST /api/chat.postMessage
↓
All 5 API responses aggregated; LLM synthesises summary
↓
Final response returned; all 5 tool calls logged with single conversation_id
Managing Five OAuth Sessions Simultaneously
Multi-Tool Session Management

Challenge
Solution
Implementation Detail
5 different access tokens
Per-service token store
Encrypted key-value store keyed by
(user_id, service_id)
5 different expiry times
Proactive pre-fetching + refresh
Check expiry before each call; refresh
if < 5 min remaining
5 different OAuth consent grants
One-time consent per service
User consents once; tokens cached
with offline_access scope
Identity propagation per call
User token per service (not shared)
Each tool call uses user's own token
for that service
Scope isolation
Minimal scopes per service
GitHub token has only repo:read; SN
token only incident:write
Partial failure handling
Graceful degradation
If Confluence fails, continue other
tools; report partial results
Token expiry mid-workflow
Just-in-time refresh
Check + refresh before each API call;
retry once on 401
Audit correlation
Single conversation_id + span_id per
tool
OpenTelemetry trace with parent
span = conversation; child spans =
tools
Scope Isolation Between Tools
A critical security principle is that OAuth scopes granted for one service must never be passed to another.
Each tool call must use the token scoped specifically to that service. The orchestrator maintains a
per-service token map and must not allow token reuse across services.
Anti-Patterns to Avoid in Multi-Tool Agents
 NEVER use a single broad-scope service account token for all tool calls
 NEVER share one service's OAuth token with another service
 NEVER cache unencrypted access tokens in conversation context / prompt
 NEVER include access tokens in LLM input or output (prompt injection risk)
 NEVER allow the LLM to directly construct API URLs — use typed tool schemas only
 NEVER skip per-service authorization checks in the name of performance

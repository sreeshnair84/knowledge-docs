# Tool Authentication & Connector Models

**OAuth Flows, SAML, OIDC, API Keys, PATs, GitHub Apps, and Marketplace Connectors**

*Enterprise AI Authentication Research · Part 2 of 7*

Enterprise AI agents connect to dozens of data sources and action surfaces. Each integration uses a distinct authentication mechanism — OAuth 2.0, SAML assertions, OIDC tokens, API keys, Personal Access Tokens (PATs), service accounts, GitHub Apps, or marketplace-installed apps. This guide details the authentication model for each major connector category.

**Connector Categories:**

- **Source Code:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- **Knowledge:** Confluence, SharePoint, Google Drive, Notion
- **ITSM:** ServiceNow, Jira
- **Communication:** Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **CRM:** Salesforce
- **Developer Platforms:** Azure DevOps

## Source Code Connectors

### GitHub

GitHub offers three primary authentication mechanisms for AI connectors: OAuth Apps, GitHub Apps, and Personal Access Tokens. For enterprise AI agents, **GitHub Apps are strongly preferred** because they provide fine-grained, repository-scoped installation tokens that expire after one hour, eliminating long-lived credential risks.

| Method | Scope Granularity | Token Lifetime | Best For | Audit Visibility |
|--------|------------------|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| OAuth App | User-level scopes (coarse) | Token until revoked | User-delegated access | GitHub Audit Log |
| **GitHub App** | **Fine-grained per-installation** | **Installation token: 1 h** | **AI agent integrations** | **Full org audit log** |
| PAT (classic) | User-level, broad | Until expiry (max 1 yr) | Developer automation | Partial — no per-call log |
| Fine-grained PAT | Repository-scoped | Until expiry (max 1 yr) | CI/CD, limited automation | GitHub Audit Log |
| SAML SSO token | Requires org SAML auth | Session-based | Enterprise SSO enforcement | IdP + GitHub logs |

**GitHub App Authentication Flow:**

```
1  AI platform (or GitHub App) registers as a GitHub App in the organisation
   ↓
2  Organisation admin installs the GitHub App, selects repositories
   ↓
3  App receives installation_id and generates a signed JWT (valid 10 min)
   ↓
4  App exchanges JWT for installation access token (valid 1 hour)
   ↓
5  AI agent uses installation token to call GitHub API within granted permissions
   ↓
6  Token expires; agent generates new JWT and exchanges for fresh installation token
   ↓
7  All API calls logged to GitHub Audit Log under the App's identity + acting user
```

**Identity Propagation:** When a GitHub App acts on behalf of a user (e.g. creating a PR), it should use the user-to-server token flow: the user authorises the App via OAuth, and the App's API calls use the user's access token scoped to the App's permissions. This ensures GitHub records the acting user, not the App identity, in the commit or PR audit trail.

### GitLab

| Method | Scope | Lifetime | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| OAuth 2.0 (auth code) | Delegated user scopes | 2 h access / refresh | Recommended for user-delegated AI access |
| Personal Access Token | `api`, `read_user`, etc. | Until revoked or expiry | Admin-managed; consider rotating |
| Project Access Token | Project-scoped | Until expiry | Best for single-project AI integrations |
| Group Access Token | Group-scoped | Until expiry | Enterprise multi-project agents |
| Deploy Token | `read_registry`, `read_repository` | Until revoked | CI/CD and read-only agents |

### Bitbucket

| Method | Scope | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| OAuth 2.0 (Bitbucket Cloud) | Delegated user/account scopes | Access token (1 h) + refresh token |
| App Password | User-level granular permissions | Not tied to OAuth; no expiry; use with caution |
| Repository Access Token (DC/Server) | Repository-scoped | Available in Data Center; recommended |
| HTTP Access Token (Cloud) | Workspace / project / repo level | Replaces App Passwords for modern use |

## Knowledge Connectors

### Confluence (Atlassian)

Confluence uses Atlassian's OAuth 2.0 3LO (Three-Legged OAuth) for delegated access and OAuth 2.0 (auth code grant) for service-to-service. AI connectors should use 3LO to act as the authenticated user, ensuring space and page permissions are respected. Service accounts should be used only for background indexing, not interactive retrieval.

| Method | Use Case | Scopes | Limitation |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)** | **User-delegated read/write** | `read:page:confluence`, `write:confluence-content` | **Requires user consent per tenant** |
| OAuth 2.0 (service) | Background crawling/indexing | `read:confluence-space.summary`, etc. | Acts as service account — no user context |
| Basic Auth (deprecated) | Legacy on-prem only | N/A | Not recommended; no token rotation |
| PAT (Data Center) | Automation on-prem | User-scoped | Supported in DC 7.9+; user context preserved |

### SharePoint / Microsoft 365

SharePoint authentication flows through Microsoft Entra ID. AI agents should use **delegated (user) permissions via OAuth 2.0 OBO**, never application permissions with site-wide access. The Microsoft Graph SharePoint API enforces site, list, and item-level permissions consistent with what the acting user can access in the SharePoint UI.

| Permission Type | Token Type | Access Level | AI Agent Recommendation |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Delegated (user)** | User access token via OBO | User's actual permissions | **STRONGLY PREFERRED** |
| Application (client credentials) | App access token | Tenant-wide or site collection | **AVOID for interactive AI — over-privileged** |
| SharePoint Add-in (legacy) | ACS token | App-only or user-combined | Deprecated — do not use for new integrations |

### Google Drive

| Method | Scope Examples | Use Case |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| OAuth 2.0 (auth code) | `drive.readonly`, `drive.file` | User-delegated AI access to Drive |
| Service Account + DWD | `drive` (impersonation) | Admin-level indexing (Domain-Wide Delegation) |
| Service Account (standard) | `drive.readonly` | Access only to files shared with service account |
| API Key | Public files only | No user context — not suitable for enterprise AI |

:::warning Domain-Wide Delegation (DWD) Risk
    Domain-Wide Delegation grants service accounts access to **ALL** users' Drive data. DWD should **NEVER** be granted to AI agent service accounts — use OAuth user delegation instead. Restrict service account keys with IAM conditions; prefer Workload Identity Federation. Audit service account key usage via Cloud Audit Logs: `data_access` log type.

### Notion

| Method | Scope | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| OAuth 2.0 (public integration) | Workspace-level read/write | User installs via OAuth; access limited to shared pages |
| Internal Integration Token | Workspace-scoped | Admin-created; no user context; needs explicit page share |

---

## ITSM Connectors

### ServiceNow

For AI agent integrations, **OAuth 2.0 with the Authorization Code grant** is recommended for user-delegated actions. The client credentials grant is available for background service accounts. ServiceNow also supports mutual TLS for MID Server communications.

| Method | Grant Type | User Context | Recommended |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **OAuth 2.0 Auth Code** | Authorization Code | Yes (acting user) | **Yes — for interactive AI actions** |
| OAuth 2.0 Client Creds | Client Credentials | No (service account) | Background tasks only |
| Basic Auth | N/A | Yes (configured user) | No — insecure, no token rotation |
| SAML Bearer Assertion | JWT Bearer | Yes (asserted identity) | Enterprise SSO contexts |
| MID Server Certificate | mTLS | No (MID Server identity) | On-prem connectivity only |

### Jira (Atlassian)

| Method | Scope | Context | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)** | `read:issue:jira`, `write:issue:jira` | Acting user | **Preferred for AI agents** |
| PAT (Data Center) | User-scoped | Acting user | Supported in DC 8.14+ |
| API Token (Cloud) | User-scoped (basic auth) | User account | Acceptable; no OAuth flow |
| Connect App | Project-scoped | App identity or user | Marketplace connectors |

---

## Communication Connectors

### Slack

Slack uses OAuth 2.0 for app authorisation. AI connectors should be implemented as Slack Apps using the `auth.v2` flow. Slack distinguishes between bot tokens (app identity) and user tokens (acting-user identity). For AI agents posting on behalf of users, **user tokens with explicit consent** are required to maintain identity transparency.

| Token Type | Identity | Scopes | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Bot token (`xoxb-`) | App/Bot identity | `chat:write`, `channels:read` | Background notifications, app-driven posts |
| **User token (`xoxp-`)** | Specific Slack user | `chat:write`, `users:read` | **Post as user — AI agent user delegation** |
| App-level token (`xapp-`) | App identity (Socket Mode) | `connections:write` | WebSocket-based event handling |

### Microsoft Teams

| Method | Identity | Scopes | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Graph API (delegated)** | Acting user via OBO | `Chat.ReadWrite`, `ChannelMessage.Send` | **Preferred for AI agent messages** |
| Graph API (application) | App identity | `Chat.ReadWrite.All` (admin consent) | Background bots; avoid for user delegation |
| Bot Framework | Bot identity | Bot-specific permissions | Conversational bots; not full API access |
| Teams Toolkit / Copilot Ext. | User or Bot | Plugin-specific scopes | Copilot Extensions manifest-defined |

## CRM Connectors — Salesforce

Salesforce uses OAuth 2.0 as its primary API authentication mechanism. For AI agents, the **Web Server Flow (auth code + PKCE)** is recommended for user-delegated access.

| Flow | User Context | When to Use | Security Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Web Server (Auth Code + PKCE)** | Yes | Interactive user-delegated AI access | **Recommended; PKCE prevents code interception** |
| JWT Bearer (OAuth 2.0) | Asserted (pre-approved) | Background service agent | Requires admin pre-authorisation per user |
| User-Agent Flow | Yes | Browser-based only | Deprecated; implicit flow security risks |
| Client Credentials | No (service account) | System-to-system (no user) | Use only for non-user background tasks |
| Device Flow | Yes | CLI tools, kiosk | For environments without browser |

---

## Developer Platforms — Azure DevOps

| Method | Identity | Scope | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| **OAuth 2.0 (Entra ID)** | User delegated | `vso.code`, `vso.work` | **Preferred; integrates with Entra SSO** |
| PAT | User identity | Granular per-feature | Easy to use; ensure rotation policy |
| Service Principal | App identity (Entra) | Service connection scopes | For CI/CD pipelines, not interactive AI |
| Managed Identity | Azure resource identity | As configured | Azure-hosted agents only; keyless |

## OAuth Flow Patterns for AI Connectors

### Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Recommended)

```
1  AI agent generates code_verifier (random) and code_challenge = SHA256(code_verifier)
   ↓
2  Redirect user to IdP:
   /authorize?response_type=code&code_challenge=...&code_challenge_method=S256
   ↓
3  User authenticates and grants consent at IdP
   ↓
4  IdP redirects to redirect_uri with authorization code
   ↓
5  AI agent sends POST /token with code + code_verifier (no client secret in public client)
   ↓
6  IdP validates code_challenge and issues access_token + refresh_token
   ↓
7  AI agent stores tokens; uses access_token for API calls; refresh_token for silent renewal
```

### OAuth 2.0 Device Flow (CLI / Headless AI)

```
1  AI agent POSTs to /devicecode endpoint: receives device_code + user_code + verification_uri
   ↓
2  Agent displays user_code and verification_uri to user (e.g. in chat message)
   ↓
3  User opens verification_uri in browser and enters user_code
   ↓
4  Agent polls /token endpoint with device_code until user completes authorisation
   ↓
5  On success, agent receives access_token + refresh_token
   ↓
6  Agent uses tokens for subsequent API calls on behalf of the user
```

### JWT Bearer / On-Behalf-Of Flow

```
1  AI platform receives user access token (from user's login to AI platform)
   ↓
2  AI runtime sends token exchange request:
   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
   ↓
3  IdP validates the incoming token and confirms the user's identity
   ↓
4  IdP issues new access_token scoped to the downstream service (e.g. GitHub, SharePoint)
   ↓
5  AI agent uses new scoped token to call downstream API
   ↓
6  Downstream API sees user identity (sub claim) in the token — not the AI platform identity
```

## Security Best Practices for Tool Authentication

- Always prefer OAuth 2.0 with PKCE over implicit flow or API keys
- Use GitHub Apps over OAuth Apps for granular, installation-scoped GitHub access
- **Never use Domain-Wide Delegation (DWD) for interactive AI agent Google Drive access**
- Store OAuth tokens encrypted at rest; use HSM or KMS-backed encryption
- Implement automatic refresh token rotation; treat refresh tokens as high-value secrets
- Use Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) where available (Microsoft 365, Entra ID)
- Audit all token issuances and API calls; correlate with conversation/session IDs
